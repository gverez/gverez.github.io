### Emotion [p. 150]

>Neither pleasure, then, nor approbation, nor benevolence, nor sympathy, is always found with love. Is there anything that is? I think that there is one thing. When B loves C, he feels that he is connected with him by a bond of peculiar strength and intimacy – a bond stronger and more intimate than any other by which two selves can be joined. In present experience, as was said above, our knowledge of any other self is never perception, and is reached through a double mediation. Yet there are times when the intimacy of the relation in love is felt to be scarcely less than the intimacy of a man’s relation with his own self.
>
>And this seems to me to be the essence of love. Love is an emotion which springs from a sense of union with another self. The sense of union is essential – without it there is no love. And it is sufficient – whenever there is a sense of a sufficiently close union, then there is love, whatever may be the qualities of lover and beloved, and whatever may be the other relations between them.
>
>This leads us to another consideration about love – that is is more independent than any other emotion of the qualities of the substance towards which it is felt. […]
>
>We have thus determined, as far as we can, what is the nature of love, as we see it in our present experience. And now we return to the original question – the place which will be held by love in absolute reality. I believe that in absolute reality every self will love every other self whom he directly perceives.
>
>We came to the conclusion that no condition was necessary for love except that the love should be conscious of his unity with the beloved. Now every man who knows any other is in some degree conscious of his unity with him. But in present experience the consciousness of unity is not always strong enough to be love, since we do not love all the people we know. […]
>
>In absolute reality all the life of every self is, or is dependent on, love. The self has no parts except his perceptions himself, of other selves, and of parts of selves. All perceptions of other selves are states of love. His perceptions of the parts of other selves are parts of states of love, and, as we shall see later, derive their emotional and volitional qualities from this. And his perceptions of himself and of his parts, as we shall also see, derive their emotional and volitional qualities from the fact that he loves others. In absolute reality, then, love is supreme, not only in value – for that we have not to wait for absolute reality – but supreme in power. Nothing is alien to love, everything is dependent on it. The harmony and the absence of distraction which this involves must increase the intensity of love – all the more because this supremacy of love will not only be real, but will be known as real.
>
>Absolute reality is timeless. We shall see later that this makes the value of absolute reality infinite in amount. But the fact that love in absolute reality has infinite value does not, as might perhaps be supposed at first sight, involve that its intensity is infinite. The infinity comes in a different dimension from the intensity – the dimension of the C series, which in present experience appears as time. The timelessness of absolute reality has thus no direct effect on the intensity of love in that reality. But it has an indirect effect. […]
>
>All these causes, then, will operate to make the intensity of love in absolute reality greater, much greater, than in present experience. But the first – the greater unity which comes with perception – seems to me to be much the most important of all of them. […]
>
>We are now able to return to a question which we left unsolved at the end of the last chapter. We saw there that in absolute reality there could be no volitions which were not perceptions, and that there could be no ungratified volitions. But it was not then possible to determine whether all the perceptions were volitions, or even to determine whether any of them were so.
>
>But now we can answer this question. I shall love all the other selves which I directly perceive. And acquiescence is a necessary consequence of love. I may not get happiness from my beloved, or from my love of him. I may not approve of him morally. I may desire that many of his qualities should have been otherwise. But there is one thing I must desire if I love him. I desire his existence. I want him to be there.

### Emotion and volition [p. 329]

>When we considered the nature of the existent […] we found that the universe consists of selves, which form a set of parts of the universe, and that each self contains a set of parts which are perceptions, and so on without end. We found that each of those perceptions has the quality of being an emotion. The direct perception of another self is an emotion of love. The perception of my own self is, in consequence of this, an emotion of self-reverence. The indirect perception of other selves is an emotion of affection. The perception of parts of other selves, or of myself, is an emotion of complacency.

### Pre-existence and post-existence [p. 391]

>The chief ways in which memory assists progress are three. In the first place, it may make us wiser. The events which we have seen, and the conclusions at which we have arrived, may be preserved in memory, and so increase our wisdom. In the second place, it may make us more virtuous. The memory, e.g., of a temptation, whether it has been resisted or successful, may help us in resisting present temptation. In the third place, it may tell us that people to whom we are now related are the people whom we have loved in the past, and this may determine, or help to determine, our present love of them.
>
>T>he value of memory, then, is that by its means the past may serve the wisdom, the virtue, and the love that are present. If the past can help the future in a like manner without the aid of memory, the absence of memory need not destroy the possibility of an improvement spreading over many lives. […]
>
>Now we cannot doubt that a character may remain determined by an event which has been forgotten. I have forgotten most of the good and evil acts which I have done in my present life. And yet each has left a trace on my character. And so a man may carry over into the next life the dispositions and tendencies which he has gained by the moral contests of this life, and the value of these experiences will not have been destroyed by the death which has destroyed the memory of them.
>
>There remains love. The problem here is more important, if, as I have tried to show, the entire life of each self centres round and depends on his love for selves, and if, as I believe, it is love which is the supreme value of life. The gain which the memory of the past gives us here is that the memory of past love for any person can strengthen our present love for him. And, if the value of past love is not to be lost when memory ceases, it must still in some way strengthen our present love. The knowledge which we acquire, and the efforts which we make, are directed towards ends which are not themselves, and, if these ends are attained, we need not grieve if the means pass away. But love has no end but itself. If it has gone, it helps us but little that we have kept anything it has brought us. […]
>
>And thus both our conditions are satisfied. Love can be greater in a later life because it was there in an earlier life, and the fact that two people love one another in this life is a reason for holding that they will love one another in various future lives. The value of love, then, does not cease with the cessation of its memory.

### Good and evil [p. 413]

>If we consider knowledge, it is clear that there is no amount of knowledge which is the greatest possible. Even if a self should perceive every self in the universe, and every part of every self, and should perceive them as having all the characteristics which they do have – even then he would have a greater amount of knowledge if, in addition to these selves, there were also other selves which he knew. For no number of selves in the universe is the greatest possible number.
>
>So also with emotions. The motion which is most generally held to be intrinsically good, is love. And the amount of love, in the case of any particular self, varies with the number of people he loves, and the intensity with which he loves them. Even if he should love all the other selves in the universe, his love would be greater if there were other selves, whom he also loved. Nor is the intensity of love capable of a maximum. There is always an intensity of love greater than any given intensity.
