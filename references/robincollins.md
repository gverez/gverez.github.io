## An epistemological critique of Bohmian mechanics <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Introduction [p. 265]

>In this paper, I argue that, as currently developed, Bohm's theory does not provide a better explanation of observable phenomena than a phenomenalist account of quantum mechanics, that is, an account that merely takes the phenomenological laws of quantum mechanics as its unexplained given. Thus, by a version of Ockam's razor, I conclude that we do not have sufficient reason to believe that Bohm's theory is (approximately) true that is, that it provides a basically correct account of the way the world is. Although not everyone interested in Bohm's theory is concerned with its truth, it is an issue that should be of concern to those trying to understand what quantum mechanics tells us about the nature of the world.
>
>To avoid misunderstanding, however, I should stress several things about the aims and scope of my argument. First, my argument only applies to the deterministic, non-relativistic version of Bohm's theory. Second, it does not address the issue of whether Bohm's theory might have other virtues besides truth, such as that of providing a predictively and conceptually useful (though perhaps false) model of an underlying physical reality, as for instance, Bohr's “planetary” model of the atom does. And finally, it does not address the issue of whether Bohm's theory provides the best realist (as opposed to instrumentalist) “interpretation” of quantum mechanics.

### Some epistemological principles [p. 265]

>Every theory has a set of fundamental postulates that it leaves unexplained and by which it tries to account for the observed phenomena (though what exactly these fundamental postulates are might vary depending on how one formulates the theory). For example, when realistically interpreted, classical atomic theory's most fundamental postulates can be thought of as being that atoms exist which obey the laws of classical mechanics, along with either the equiprobability or ergodic assumption of classical statistical mechanics. Now, even from a realist perspective, to be justified in believing a theory, there must be some truth-indicating theoretical advantage in accepting the fundamental postulates Of the theory as unexplained givens instead of simply accepting its phenomenalist counterpart that is, accepting the data and the phenomenological laws that the theory tries to explain as unexplained (though not necessarily unexplainable) givens. Accepting the fundamental postulates of atomic theory, for instance, supposedly had the theoretical virtue of simplifying our understanding of the physical world: instead of having to postulate as separate unexplained givens the gas laws, the laws governing chemical combinations, the laws governing Brownian motion, and the like, we now only had to postulate two givens, the existence of atoms that obey the laws of classical mechanics and the equiprobability (or ergodic) assumption underlying statistical mechanics, and from these derive everything else. If instead, for each of these observational laws, we had to hypothesize a different set of laws at the atomic level, the atomic explanation would not have simplified or unified our understanding of the physical world, and thus we would not have had sufficient reason to believe it.
>
>The above example illustrates an epistemological rule that can be stated as follows: in order to have sufficient reason to believe that a theory is (approximately) true, the theory must at least offer some truth-indicating theoretical advantage – that is, make some explanatory progress – over its phenomenalist counterpart. Since the phenomenalist account is the account that makes the minimal possible ontological commitments, this rule is actually a specific case of a more general epistemological principle which seems to be widely accepted by those who philosophers call “scientific realists” - that is, roughly those who want to claim that our fundamental physical theories are not merely useful predictive devices, but really tell us the way the world is. This principle, a version of Ockam's razor, can be precisely stated as follows. Suppose we have two hypotheses, H1 and H, such that (i) H1 both entails H and makes more ontological commitments than H does, and (ii) H accounts for all the observable phenomena that H1 does. Then, we can only have sufficient reason to believe H1 is approximately true (instead of, for instance, merely believing that H is true) if H1 makes some explanatory progress over H: that is, if the unexplained givens of H1 have some truth-indicating theoretical virtue – such as simplicity – that the unexplained givens of H do not have.
>
>Of course, even among scientific realists it will be a controversial matter in many cases whether a virtue, such as simplicity or some aesthetic virtue, is really a truth-indicating theoretical virtue.
>
>I shall argue below that, when compared with the phenomenalist account of quantum mechanics, Bohm's deterministic, non-relativistic hidden-variable theory fails to meet the above epistemological rules, and thus that we do not have sufficient reason to believe it is (approximately) true. Before doing this, however, we first need to explicate the theoretical givens of Bohmian mechanics.

### Basic ontology of deterministic Bohmian mechanics [p. 266]

>I shall consider Bohm's theory to be a global theory applying to the whole universe, for as Dürr et al. (1992) point out, this is the only way of guaranteeing that Bohm's theory is consistent.

### Bohmian mechanics versus a phenomenalist account [p. 268]

>Consequently, since Bohmian mechanics makes more ontological commitments than the phenomenalist account, it follows that Bohm's theory ends up increasing our ontology without offering us any truth-indicating theoretical advantage in return. Thus I conclude, by the epistemological principles elaborated in Section II, we do not have sufficient reason to believe that Bohm's theory is (approximately) true. […]

>A major problem with this argument is that it treats the existence of fundamental particles and atoms as established. But, I shall argue, if Bohmian mechanics is our best account of the behavior of fundamental particles and atoms, then we cannot take their existence as given. I shall focus my argument on atoms, though it applies more generally. As is well known, from about the middle of the nineteenth century until the early part of this century, a heated debate occurred between those who proposed a phenomenalist approach to physics and those who advocated the atomic theory, a debate that was eventually decided in favor of atomic theory around the turn of the century (see Nye 1972). What decided the debate was that by using atomic theory, along with the equiprobability assumption of statistical mechanics, one could derive a whole host of divergent phenomenological laws such as gas laws, the laws governing Brownian motion, the laws governing chemical combinations, the laws of thermodynamics, and the like. Thus, atomic theory allowed one to account for a large body of phenomena by accepting fewer unexplained givens (such as the existence of atoms and the equiprobability or ergodic assumption) than the phenomenalist account, which required one to accept a host of phenomenological laws as givens. Put simply, atomic theory had the virtue of hypothesizing a simpler set of givens than the phenomenalist account. Moreover, atomic theory proved more fruitful than the phenomenalist program.
>
>Thus, based on considerations of its theoretical virtues, a realist had good grounds for accepting classical atomic theory and its accompanying statistical mechanics, even though classical statistical mechanics has been plagued with foundational difficulties. If, however, we conjoin Bohm's theory with atomic theory, we can no longer simply assume that we have such grounds since Bohm's theory introduces new (and problematic) postulates. Rather, we must compare the theoretical advantage of Bohmian mechanics, with its attendant assumption that microscopic particles exist, to the phenomenalist account, as we are doing. To merely assume the existence of microscopic particles would beg the question.
>
>One might argue that, unlike Bohm's theory, the phenomenalist account has the classic problem confronting instrumentalists of drawing a distinction between observable and unobservable entities. This is not the case, however. First, the phenomenalist account does not presuppose this distinction because it does not presuppose the existence of unobservable entities. But, second, neither does it presuppose, as classical instrumentalists seem to, that theoretical terms can be classified into those that, if they referred, would refer to unobservable entities and those that, if they referred, would refer to observable entities. For, unlike classical instrumentalism, the above phenomenalist account does not say anything about what terms in a theory refer, or are likely to refer, simply because it is not an account of the range of reference of scientific theories. Of course, the phenomenalist account must presuppose that we have some idea of what counts as a measurement result, but this idea need not admit of a precise definition any more than we need a precise definition of a chair in order to make intelligible statements about, for instance, the probability of a randomly selected chair holding a 500 pound human being.

### Conclusion [p. 275]

>Finally, I should emphasize that I have neither attempted to show that Bohmian mechanics is false, nor that it is not worth pursuing as a research program, nor that its fundamental postulates will not one day receive further justification. Neither have I tried to argue that we should believe the phenomenalist account of quantum mechanics. Rather, I have only intended to argue that at present, we do not have sufficient reason to believe that Bohmian mechanics is (approximately) true.
