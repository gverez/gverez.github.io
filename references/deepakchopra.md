## Day 3 of 21 days of Abundance <a name="arkhe"></a>
*2019*

>What is reality? Is this what we can experience with our senses or is it something else, something deeper? Consider for a moment. Where was the chair your were sitting on before it was created? Where was a newborn before she came into this world? Just because we cannot see or touch something does not mean it does not exist. It simply means we can't experience it in our three-dimensional world at this moment. [...]
>
>We live our lives primarily on the physical plane which includes everything that has form or substance. What we commonly refer to as matter. Some look at this physical realm and see lack, others see abundance. [...]
>
>While we believe matter to be reality, we often view reality as changeless. Yet matter and form continuously change. So, what then is reality? As we exist in the physical plane, we also live at the level of the mind. The mind is that part of us that perceives, thinks, reasons, and evaluates. The mind is potential energy and because of this, we can change our physical world simply by changing our thoughts and beliefs. Beyond the mind, at the deepest level of consciousness, resides the spirit. This is the part of us that is eternal, unchanging and imbued with pure, unlimited potential. Tapping into this potential is what enables us to manifest miracles. The world out there may appear to be objective but in fact, it is subjective. A construct of our own interpretations. Our words, thoughts and beliefs create specific results in the physical world. Therefore, abundance doesn't spring from an external source, rather it comes from within. From thought, intention, attention, and expectation. You, as a powerful creative being, can change your perceptions, change your mind, and change your reality, by transforming your thoughts and expectations. You can being to speak and understand nature's language and harness its infinite flow of energy, information and intelligence, to enjoy the great bounty of spirit that is your birth.
