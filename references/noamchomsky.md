### Language as a natural object [p. 2]

>In the present case, the theories of language and mind that seem best established on naturalistic grounds attribute to the mind/brain computational properties of a kind that are well-understood, though not enough is known to explain how a structure constructed of cells can have such properties. That poses a unification problem, but of a familiar kind.
>
>We do not know how eventual unification might proceed in this case, or if we have hit upon the right categories to seek to unify, or even if the question falls within our cognitive reach. We have no warrant simply to assume that mental properties are to be reduced to “neural network properties”, to take a typical claim (Patricia Churchland 1994). Similar pronouncements have often proven false in other domains and are without any particular scientific merit in this case. If the thesis about neural networks is understood as a research proposal, well and good; we wait and see. If more is intended, rather serious questions arise.
>
>As for the matter of cognitive reach, if humans are part of the natural world, not supernatural beings, then human intelligence has its scope and limits, determined by initial design. We can thus anticipate that certain questions will not fall within their cognitive reach, just as rats are unable to run mazes with numerical properties, lacking the appropriate concepts. Such questions we might call “mysteries-for-humans”, just as some questions we raise, and others we do not know how to formulate properly or at all. […]
>
>These concerns, at the origins of modern science, have something of the flavour of contemporary discussion of the “mind-body problem”. They also raise questions about what is at stake. Thomas Nagel observes that “the various attempts to carry out this apparently impossible task [of reducing mind to matter] and the arguments to show that they have failed, make up the history of the philosophy of mind during the past fifty years”. The hopeless task is to “complete the materialist world picture” by translating accounts of “mental phenomena” in terms of “a description that is either explicitly physical or uses only terms that can apply to what is entirely physical”, or perhaps gives “assertibility conditions” on “externally observable grounds” (Nagel 1993). In an instructive review of a century of the philosophy of mind, Tyler Burge discusses the emergence of “naturalism” (“materialism”, “physicalism”) in the 1960s as “one of the few orthodoxies in American philosophy”: the view that there are no mental states (properties, etc.) “over and above ordinary physical entities, entities identifiable in the physical sciences or entities that common sense would regard as physical” (Burge 1992).
>
>Such discussions assume, contrary to Newton and his contemporaries, that Newton remained within “the materialist world picture”; that would be true only if we understand “the materialist world picture” to be whatever science constructs, however it departs from “mechanical causes”. To put it differently, the discussions presuppose some antecedent understanding of what is physical or material, what are the physical entities. These terms had some sense within the mechanical philosophy, but what do they mean in a world bases on Newton’s “mysterious force”, or still more mysterious notions of fields of force, curved space, infinite one-dimensional strings in ten-dimensional space, or whatever science concocts tomorrow? Lacking a concept of “matter” or “body” or “the physical”, we have no coherent way to formulate issues related to the “mind-body problem”. These were real problems of science in the days of the mechanical philosophy. Since its demise, the sciences postulate whatever finds a place in intelligible explanatory theory, however offensive that may be to common sense. Only on unjustified dualistic assumptions can such qualms be raises specifically about the domain of the mental, not other aspects of the world. […]
>
>It is not hard to find contemporary counterparts in the discussion of the mind-body problem, whatever that is supposed to be. There is, I think, a good deal to learn from the history of the sciences since they abandoned common sense foundations, always with some uneasiness about just what they were doing. We should by now be able to accept that we can do no more than seek “best theories”, with no independent standard for evaluation apart from contribution to understanding, and hope for unification with no advance doctrine about how, or whether, it can be achieved. As Michael Friedman puts the point, “the philosophers of the modern tradition”, from Descartes, “are not best understood as attempting to stand outside the new science so as to show, from some mysterious point outside of science itself, that our scientific knowledge somehow ‘mirrors’ an independently existing reality. Rather, [they] start from the fact of modern scientific knowledge as a fixed point, as it were. Their problem is not so much to justify this knowledge from some ‘higher’ standpoint as to articulate the new philosophical conceptions that are forced upon us by the new science.” In Kant’s words, mathematics and the science of nature stand in no need of philosophical inquiry for themselves, “but for the sake of another science: metaphysics” (Friedman 1993). […]
>
>We also should be able now to adopt an attitude towards the mind-body problem formulated in the wake of Newton’s demolition of materialism and the “mechanical philosophy”: for example, by Joseph Priestley, whose conclusion was “not that all reduces to matter, but rather that the kind of matter on which the two-substance view is based does not exist”, and “with the altered concept of matter, the more traditional ways of posing the question of the nature of thought and of its relations to the brain do not fit. We have to think of a complex organized biological system with properties the traditional doctrine would have called mental and physical” (Yolton 1983, p. 114).
>
>In Priestley’s words, matter “is possessed of powers of attraction and repulsion” that act at a “real and in general an assignable distance from what we call the body itself”, properties that are “absolutely essential to [the] very nature” of matter. We thus overcome the naive belief that bodies (atoms aside) have inherent solidity and impenetrability, dismissing arguments based on “vulgar phraseology” and “vulgar apprehensions”, as in the quest for the me referred to in the phrase “my body”. With the Newtonian discovers, matter “ought to rise in our esteem, as making a nearer approach to the nature of spiritual and immaterial beings”, the “odium [of] solidity, inertness, or sluggishness” having been removed. Matter is no more “incompatible with sensation and thought” than with attraction and repulsion. “The powers of sensation or perception and thought” are properties of a “certain organized system of matter”; properties “termed mental” are “the result (whether necessary or not) of such an organical structure as that of the brain”. It is as reasonable to believe “that the powers of sensation and thought are the necessary result of a particular organization, as that sound is the necessary result of a particular concussion of the air”. Thought in humans “is a property of the nervous system, or rather of the brain”. […]
>
>The basic contention of Priestley and other 18th century figures seems uncontroversial: thought and language are properties of organized matter – in this case, mostly the brain, not the kidney or the foot. It is unclear why the conclusion should be resurrected centuries later as an audacious and innovative proposal: “the bold assertion that mental phenomena are entirely natural and caused by the neurophysiological activities of the brain” (Paul Churchland 1994), the hypothesis “that capacities of the human mind are in fact capacities of the human brain” (Patricia Churchland 1994); or that “consciousness is a higher-level or emergent property of the brain”, “as much of the natural biological order as… photosynthesis, digestion, or mitosis” (Searle 1992), nor why Nagel should describe this last as the “metaphysical heart” of a “radical thesis” that “would be a major addition to the possible answers to the mind-body problem” if properly clarified (as he considers unlikely: Nagel 1993). Every year or two a book appears by some distinguished scientist with the “startling conclusion” or “astonishing hypothesis” that thought in humans “is a property of the nervous system, or rather of the brain”, the “necessary result of a particular organization” of matter, as Priestley put the matter long ago. […]
>
>The current situation is that we have good and improving theories of some aspects of language and mind, but only rudimentary ideas about the relation of any of this to the brain. […]
>
>Even very young infants appear to have something like the adult phonetic system in place, perhaps a special refinement of a broader vertebrate category. Mehler and Dupoux (1994) propose the working hypothesis that “newborns are sensitive to all contrasts that can appear in all natural languages, and in exactly the way as adults”, with “learning by forgetting” under early expose, so that before the child is a year old, the cognitive system has selected some subpart of the available potential. […]
>
>These ideas constitute a radical departure from a rich tradition of some 2500 years. If correct, they show not only that languages are cast to very much the same mould, with a near invariant computational procedure and only restricted lexical variation, but also that there are no rules or constructions in anything like the traditional sense, which was carried over to early generative grammar: no rules for formation of relative clauses in English, for example. Rather, the traditional constructions – verb phrase, relative clause, passive, etc. – are taxonomic artifacts, their properties resulting from the interaction of far more general principles. […]
>
>As for semantics, insofar as we understand language use, the argument for a reference-based semantics (apart from an internalist syntactic version) seems to me weak. It is possible that natural language has only syntax and pragmatics; it has a “semantics” only in the sense of “the study of how this instrument, whose formal structure and potentialities of expression are the subject of syntactic investigation, is actually put to use in a speech community”, to quote the earliest formulation in generative grammar 40 years ago, influenced by Wittgenstein, Austin and others. In this view, natural language consists of internalist computations and performance systems that access them along with much other information and belief, carrying out their instructions in particular ways to enable us to talk and communicate, among other things. There will be no provision for what Scott Soames calls “the central semantic fact about language, … that it is used to represent the world”, because it is not assumed that language is used to represent the world, in the intended sense (Soames 1989, cite by Smith 1992 as the core issue for philosophers of language).
>
>Before turning to more detailed issues relating to the internalist perspective on language, let me mention some limits. Some have already been suggested: general issues of intentionality, including those of language use, cannot reasonably be assumed to fall within naturalistic inquiry. The matter can be further clarified by returning to Cartesian dualism, the scientific hypothesis that sought to capture, in particular, the apparent fact that normal language use lies beyond the bounds of any possible machine. The Cartesian framework was undermined by the discovery that even the behavior of inorganic matter lies beyond these bounds. But the arguments can be reconstructed, though now without metaphysical implications, since the concept of matter has disappeared. So restated, they still seem to pose a complete mystery. They are, for example, unaffected by the transition from the complex artifacts that intrigued the Cartesians to today’s computers, and the brain sciences shed little light on them.
>
>Possibly, as some believe, these problems are unreal. Possibly they are real but we have not hit upon the way to approach them. Possibly that way, whatever it is, lies outside our cognitive capacities, beyond the reach of the science-forming faculty. That should not surprise us, if true, at least if we are willing to entertain the idea that humans are part of the natural world, with rich scope and corresponding limits, facing problems that they might hope to solve and mysteries that lie beyond their reach, “ultimate secrets of nature” that “ever will remain” in “obscurity” as Hume supposed, echoing some of Descartes’s own speculations.

### Language from an internalist perspective [p. 32]

>There seems no basis here for any mind-body problem and no reason to question Davidson’s thesis that there are no psychophysical laws that connect mental and physical events in an appropriate explanatory scheme; for similar reasons, there are no physico-physical laws relating ordinary talk about things to the natural sciences, even if the particular events described fall within their potential descriptive range. Distinctions between mental and other aspects of the world, in these respects, seem unwarranted, except in one respect: our theoretical understanding of language, mind, and people generally is so shallow, apart from limited domains, that we can only use our intuitive resources in thinking and talking about these matters.
>
>It is not that ordinary discourse fails to talk about the world, or that the particulars it describes do not exist, or that the accounts are too imprecise. Rather, the categories used and principles invoked need not have even loose counterparts in naturalistic inquiry. That is true even of the parts of ordinary discourse that have a quasi-naturalistic cast. How people decide whether something is water or tea is of no concern to chemistry. It is no necessary task of biochemistry to decide at what point in the transition from simple gases to bacteria we find the “essence of life”, and if some such categorization were imposed, the correspondence to common sense notions would matter no more than for the heavens, or energy, or solid. Whether ordinary usage would consider viruses “alive” is of no interest to biologists, who will categorize as they choose in terms of genes and conditions under which they function. We cannot invoke ordinary usage to judge whether François Jacob is correct in telling us that “for the biologists, the living beings only with what was able to constitute a genetic program”, though “for the chemist, in contrast, it is somewhat arbitrary to make a demarcation where there can only be continuity” (Jacob, 1973). Similarly, the concept “human being”, with its curious properties of psychic continuity, does not enter the natural sciences. The theory of evolution and other parts of biology do try to understand John Smith and his place in nature; not, however, under the description “human being” or “person” as construed in ordinary language and thought. These notions are interesting for natural language semantics and ethnoscience, but not for the branches of human biology that seek to understand the nature of John Smith and his conspecifics or what distinguishes them from apes and plants. See Putnam (1993) for a contrary view with regard to these examples. […]
>
>Some current research suggests that studies of electrical activity of the brain may provide evidence bearing on them, a conceptual impossibility according to a considerable part of the literature, which also puts forth other odd contentions: for example, that studies of perceptual displacement of clicks might provide evidence about phrase boundaries, whereas observations about anaphora in Japanese, which provide far stronger evidence on naturalistic grounds, do not constitute evidence for factual theses at all because of some lethal form of indeterminacy (Quine 1992). […]
>
>All such moves reflect some form of dualism, an insistence that we must not treat the domain of the mental, or at least the linguistic, as we do other aspects of the world.
>
>Methodological dualism has sometimes apparently been explicitly advocated. Consider Dummett’s thesis that scientific accounts fall short of philosophical explanation for conceptual reasons. To take his example, suppose that a naturalistic approach to language succeeds beyond our wildest dreams. Suppose it provides a precise account of what happens when sound waves hit the ear and are processes, is fully integrated into a scientific theory of action, and solves the unification problem, integrating the theories of cells and computational processes. We should then have a successful theory of what Jones knows when he has acquired a language: what he know about rhyme, entailment, usage appropriate to situations, and so on. But no matter how successful, Dummett writes, these discoveries would “contribute nothing to philosophy”, which requires an answer to a different question: not how knowledge is stored or used, but “how it is delivered”. The naturalistic account would be a “psychological hypothesis”, but not a “philosophical explanation”, cause it does not tell us “the form in which [the body of knowledge] is delivered” (Dummett, 1993). For the sciences, the account tells everything that can be asked about the form in which knowledge is delivered, but philosophy calls for a kind of explanation unknown in naturalistic inquiry.
>
>So understood, philosophy appears to exclude much of the core of traditional philosophy: Hume, for example, who was concerned with “the science of human nature”, and sought to find “the secret springs and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations”, including those “parts of [our] knowledge” that are derived “by the original hand of nature”, an enterprise he compared to Newton’s. Had Hume achieved these goals, he would have established “psychological hypotheses”, in Dummett’s terms, but would not yet have contributed anything to philosophy. “Philosophical explanation” requires something more than a discovery of the “secret springs and principles” of the mind and how they function.
>
>If I understand Dummett, philosophical explanation crucially involves access to consciousness. […]
>
>In the study of other aspects of the world, we are satisfied with “best theory” arguments, and there is no privileged category of evidence that provides criteria for theoretical constructions. In the study of language and mind, naturalistic theory does not suffice: we must seek “philosophical explanations”, delimit inquiry in terms of some imposed criterion, require that theoretical posits be grounded in categories of evidence selected by the philosopher, and rely on notions such as “access in principle” that have no place in naturalistic inquiry.
>
>Whatever all this means, there is a demand beyond naturalism, a form of dualism that remains to be explained and justified. […]
>
>One leading advocate, Daniel Dennett, formulates the doctrine in this way: the “naturalization of philosophy”, which he described as “one of the happiest trends in philosophy since the 1960s”, holds that “philosophical accounts of our minds, our knowledge, and our language must in the end be continuous with, or harmonious with, the natural sciences”. In a discussion of contemporary naturalism, T.R. Baldwin (1993) cites this statement to illustrate the thesis of “metaphysical naturalism”. Like other formulations, it poses some problems. What are “philosophical accounts” as distinct from others, particularly in this “naturalized” sense of philosophy? And what are the natural sciences? Surely not what is understood today, which may not be “continuous and harmonious” with tomorrow’s physics. Some Peircean ideal, perhaps? That doesn’t seem promising. What the human mind can attain in the limit? That at least is a potential topic of inquiry, but it leaves us in even worse shape in the present context. If “metaphysical naturalism” is understood as a hope for eventual unification of the study of the mental with other parts of science, no one could disagree, but it is a thesis of little interest, not “a happy trend in philosophy”.
>
>Take the version of this doctrine expressed by Quine, whom Burge identifies as the source of the contemporary orthodoxy. In his most recent formulation, the “naturalistic thesis” is that “the world is a natural science says it is, insofar as natural science is right”. What is “natural science”? Quine’s total answer is: “theories of quarks and the like”. What counts as like enough? There are hints at answers but they seem completely arbitrary, at least by ordinary naturalistic criteria (see Quine 1992).
>
>Suppose we identify the mind-body problem (or perhaps its core) as the problem of explaining how consciousness related to neural structures. If so, it seems much like others that have arisen through the history of science, sometimes with no solution: the problem of explaining terrestrial and planetary motion in terms of the “mechanical philosophy” and its contact mechanics, demonstrated to be irresolvable by Newton, and overcome by introducing what were understood to be “immaterial” forces; the problem of reducing chemistry to the world of hard particles in motion, energy, and electromagnetic waves, only overcome with the introduction of even weirder hypotheses about the nature of the physical world. In each of these cases, unification was achieved and the problem resolved not by reduction, but by quite different forms of accommodation. Even the reduction of biology to biochemistry is a bit of an illusion, since it came only a few years after the unification of chemistry and a radically new physics.
>
>These examples do differ from the consciousness-brain problem in one important way: it was possible to construct intelligible theories of the irreducible phenomena that were far from superficial, while in the case of consciousness, we do not seem to progress much beyond description and illustration of phenomena (Freudians, Jungians, and others might disagree). The matter is seen more sharply in the case of language. The normal use of language involves a “creative aspect” which, for the Cartesians, provided the best evidence for the existence of other minds. Neither the computational properties of the language faculty nor the creative aspects of use can be related in interesting ways to anything know about cells, but the two topics differ in that for the computational properties, there are intelligible explanatory theories, while for the creative aspects of use, there is only description and illustration. If so, the crucial issue is not real or apparent irreducibility, a common phenomenon in the history of science, but the fact that we can only stare in puzzlement at such aspects of mind as consciousness and expression of thought that is coherent and appropriate but uncaused, a characteristic feature of core problems of philosophy, as Colin McGinn (1993) has argued.
>
>Furthermore, apart from the fact that literal reduction is hardly the norm as science has proceeded towards unification, there is uncertainty as to whether it even makes sense as a project. Silvan Schweber (1993) writes that recent work in condensed matter physics, which has created phenomena such as superconductivity that are “genuine novelties in the universe”, has also raised earlier skepticism about the possibility of reduction to “an almost rigorously proved assertion”, leading to a conception of “emergent laws” in a new sense. Whatever the validity of the conclusion, it is at least clear that philosophical doctrines have nothing to say about it; even less so in the domain of mind and brain, where vastly less is understood.
>
>A naturalistic approach simply follows the post-Newtonian course, recognizing that we can do no more than seek the best theoretical account of the phenomena of experience and experiment, wherever the quest leads. […]
>
>When we turn to language, the internalism-externalism issues arise; though again only for the theory of meaning, not for phonology, where there could be posed in the same ways. Thus we are asked to consider whether meanings are “in the head”, or are externally determined. The conventional answer today is that they are externally determined by two kinds of factors: features of the real world, and norms of communities. […]
>
>Thinking about the world is no doubt “fundamental to our existence”, but this does not seem to a good way to gain a better understanding of the matter. […]
>
>Is there a problem with internalist (or individualist) approaches to other domains of psychology? So it is widely claimed, but on dubious grounds, I think. Take the study of hearing. One long-standing question is how the auditory cortex determines the location of a sound. There does not seem to be any “auditory map”, as there is a visual and somatosensory map. Some recent work suggests that the auditory cortex registers sound location not by spatial arrangement of neurons, but by a temporal pattern of firing in a kind of “Morse code” (Barinaga 1994, Middlebrooks, et al. 1994). The discussion is worded in the usual mixture of technical and informal discourse. Someone reading it might be misled into thinking that the theory of auditory perception is externalist, making crucial reference to “solving problems” posed by the external world of sounds. But that is an illusion. The auditory system doesn’t “solve problems” in any technical sense of this term, and if they knew how to do so, the researchers might choose to stimulate the receptors directly instead of using loudspeakers – much as they did in the computer model which, in fact, provided the main evidence for their theory of sound localization, which would work as well for a brain in a vat as for an owl turning its head to face a mouse in the brush.
>
>The same considerations apply to the study of visual perception along lines pioneered by David Marr, which has been much discussed in this connection. This work is mostly concerned with operations carried out by the retina; loosely put, the mapping of retinal images to the visual cortex. Marr’s famous three levels of analysis – computational, algorithmic, and implementation – have to do with ways of construing such mappings. Again, the theory applied to a brain in a vat exactly as it does to a person seeing an object in motion. […] If Ullman could have stimulated the retina directly, he would have done that; or the optic nerve. The investigation, Ullman writes, “concerns the nature of the internal representations used by the visual system and the processes by which they are derived” (Ullman 1979). The account is completely internalist. […] No notion like “content”, or “representation of”, figures within the theory, so there are no answers to be given as to their nature. The same is true when Marr writes that he is studying vision as “a mapping from one representation to another, and in the case of human vision, the initial representation is in no doubt – it consists of arrays of image intensity values as detected by the photoreceptors in the retina” (Marr 1982) – where “representation” is not to be understood relationally, as “representation of”.
>
>Technical presentations talk about algorithms “breaking down” under some conditions, and giving the “correct answer” in others, where the “correct answer” may be, for example, the strong three-dimensional percept given by a random dot stereogram. They may also speak of “misperception” in the case of the person or frog in the experiments, though perhaps not when a photoreceptor on a street light is activated by a searchlight rather than the sun. And they speak of the brain as “solving problems” and as “adapted to normal situations” in which the visual system “represents” objective features of the external world. Such informal usages conform to Tyler Burge’s starting point: “the premise that our perceptual experience represents or is about objects, properties, and relations that are objective”, a premise that goes beyond an individualist-internalist approach (1988). But these usages are on a par with an astronomer warning that a comet is aiming directly toward the Earth, implying no animist, intentional physics.
>
>The internalist study of language also speaks of “representations” of various kinds, including phonetic and semantic representations at the “interface” with other systems. But here too we need not ponder what is represented, seeking some objective construction from sounds or things. The representations are postulated mental entities, to be understood in the manner of a mental image of a rotating cube, whether the consequence of tachistoscopic presentations or of a real rotating cube or of stimulation of the retina in some other way; or imagine, for that matter. Accessed by performance systems, the internal representations of language enter into interpretation, thought, and action, but there is no reason to seek any other relation to the world, as might be suggested by a well-known philosophical tradition and inappropriate analogies from informal usage. Misperception raises no difficulties for this approach; it is a matter of how people assign interpretations to interactions they observe – to the reactions of a frog or person in an experiment, a photoreceptor that is “deceived”, etc. – a fair topic for internalist inquiry into the psychology of the person who is deciding what to call a “misperception”.
>
>For psychology and ethnoscience, little seems at stake in these debates. […]
>
>It is, correspondingly, a misreading of informal talk to conclude that Marr’s theory of vision attributed “intentional states that represent objective, physical properties” because “There is no other way to treat the visual system as solving the problem that the theory sees it as solving” (Burge 1986). […]
>
>Informal discussion of evolutionary processes makes use of such locutions as “solving problems”, but again that is not to be taken too seriously. Physical law provides narrow channels within which complex organisms may vary, and natural selection is doubtless a factor in determining the distribution of traits and properties within these constraints. A factor, not the factor, at least if we follow Darwin’s sensible strictures. Much concerned by the misinterpretation of his ideas, Darwin firmly denied that he attributed “the modification of species exclusively to natural selection”. […]
>
>We cannot sensibly estimate the weight that will be assigned to natural selection as a mechanism of evolution as more is learned about complex systems, the operation of physical law, the factors in spontaneous self-organization in living as in other physical systems, and so on. The status of internalist approaches is unaffected by such considerations, whether we are thinking of ants and the kidney, or language and mind.
>
>Virtually every aspect of the study of language and mind seems to me to involve unjustified non-naturalist assumptions. If this discussion is on the right track, one would want to ask why such ideas appear so compelling. The answer could be that our common sense picture of the world is profoundly dualistic. Ineradicably, just as we can’t help seeing the setting of the sun, or sharing Newton’s belief in the “mechanical philosophy” that he undermined, or watching the wave that “flees the place of its creation”, as Leonardo put it, independently of what we may know in some other corner of our minds. If so, and if metaphysical dualism has been undermined, what is left is a kind of methodological dualism, an illegitimate residue of common sense that should not be allowed to hamper efforts to gain understanding into what kind of creatures we are.
