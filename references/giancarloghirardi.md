## The macro-objectification problem and conscious perceptions <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Journal of Cosmology, vol. 14, 2011*

### Abstract [p. 1]

>We reconsider the problem of the compatibility of our definite perceptions with the linear nature of quantum theory. We review some proposed solutions to the puzzling situation implied by the possible occurrence of superpositions of different perceptions and we argue that almost all are not satisfactory. We then discuss the way out which makes explicit reference to consciousness and we underline its pros and cons. In the second part of the paper we reconsider this problem in the light of the recently proposed collapse models, which overcome the difficulties of the standard theory by adding nonlinear and stochastic terms to the evolution equation and, on the basis of a unique dynamical principle, account both for the wavy behaviour of microsystems as well as for definite macroscopic events. By taking into account that different microscopic situations can trigger different displacements of an enormous number of particles in our brains which, in turn, lead to different and definite perceptions, we make plausible that such models do not assign a peculiar role to the conscious observer. Simply, the characteristic amplification mechanism leading to the collapse implies the suppression of all but one of the nervous stimuli corresponding to different perceptions. Thus, collapse models, at the nonrelativistic level, qualify themselves as theories which can consistently account for all natural processes, among them our definite perceptions.


### The quantum measurement problem [p. 7]

>Standard quantum mechanics contains two evolution laws, the linear one typical of microsystems and the nonlinear and stochastic one corresponding to Wave Packet Reduction (WPR), and accounting for the measurement processes. The big problem derives from the fact that the theory does not contain any formal element which identifies when one or the other type of evolution occur. Actually, macroscopic systems which require a genuinely quantum treatment exist. The problem has been emphasized with admirable lucidity by the late J. Bell:
>
>>“Nobody knows what quantum mechanics says exactly about any situation, for nobody knows where the boundary really is between wavy quantum systems and the world of particular events.”


### The von Neumann chain [p. 7]

>John von Neumann has been the first to dig deeply into the measurement problem. He made an important remark. If one takes into account Eq.(7), one cannot consider it as exhaustively describing the measurement process. In fact, as it is obvious, the final state leads to the natural question: what actually is the outcome of the measurement? (i.e. where does the pointer point?). The answer is obvious: we must consider a further process aimed to ascertain which one of the eigenstates actually occurred. In this way the so-called von Neumann’s chain finds its origin. The r.h.s of Eq.(7) must be enriched by taking into account the further measuring apparatus (let us call it B) devised to identify in which of the macrostates the pointer A is. Accordingly, we must consider successive measurement procedures aiming to identify what the actual state of affairs is. […] The chain never ends but it exhibits a quite interesting feature. No matter at which point one chooses to break it, if the linear superposition is replaced by one of its terms (let us say the ith) one gets a consistent set of outcomes: the particle is found i, the macroapparatus has its macroscopic pointer pointing at the value i of the scale, the apparatus B reveals that the macroapparatus A actually points at i and so on. In brief, there is a full “final” consistency provided one breaks (at a certain level) the chain.
>
>Some remarks are at order:
>
>- This approach leaves open the stage at which the breaking must be assumed to occur, provided it occurs at some point. In this sense, it is not surprising that von Neumann and Wigner have chosen (see below) to break it at the level in which consciousness enters into play.
>- von Neumann’s has tacitly made some quite drastic assumptions concerning the unfolding of the process (typically that the measurement has 100% efficiency, that the final states are strictly orthogonal etc., a set of assumptions which are very difficult to be verified in actual experiments) and this is why one usually refers to the just described scheme as “The Ideal von Neumann’s Measurement Process”.


### The unavoidability of the problem [p. 8]

>Some authors (Primas 1990) have suggested that the previous argument arises from having described the measurement process by a too idealized scheme. That this is not the case has been proved in absolute generality in a recent paper (Bassi & Ghirardi 2000), in which it has been shown that, if quantum mechanics has unrestricted validity, the occurrence of the embarrassing superpositions of macroscopically and perceptually different states of macrosystems cannot be avoided.
>
>The original paper by Bassi and Ghirardi has given rise to a stimulating debate with B. d’Espagnat (d’Espagnat 2001). The relevant conclusion of this author, for what concerns us here, is:
>
>>“What Bassi & Ghirardi has proved is that we must either accept the break [i.e. to abandon the superposition principle] or grant that man-independent reality – to the extent that this concept is meaningful – is something more “remote from anything ordinary human experience has access to” than most scientists were up to now prepared to believe.”
>
>In the appendix the author has felt the necessity to state, as Bassi and Ghirardi have argued, that there are only two ways out of this impasse: either one accepts the break or one must assume that it is consciousness that leads to WPR.

### Superselection rule [p. 9]

>An interesting proposal (Daneri 1962), strongly supported by Rosenfeld, assumes that in principle the set of all conceivable observables of a macroscopic object is an abelian set, so that, when macrostates enter into play, the state (2) cannot be distinguished from the statistical mixture ensuing to WPR. […] This fact in turn implies that the energy of the whole system is not an observable, a quite peculiar and nonsensical fact.

### Many universes and many minds [p. 9]

>Important proposals are “The Many Universes Interpretations” of Everett (1957) and DeWitt (1971) and “The Many Minds Interpretation” of Albert and Lower (1988). The first proposal suggests that all potentialities of the state, referring to different macroscopic situations, become actual in different universes. There is a continuous multifurcation of the Universe associated to superpositions of macroscopically different states. So, when a state like the one of Eq.(7) is dynamically brought into play by the measurement interaction, one must think that there are infinitely many universes, each of them corresponding to one and only one of the perfectly meaningful terms of the superposition.
>
>The Many Minds Interpretation assumes that in place of all potentialities becoming actual in different universes, all possible perceptions occur in appropriately correlated different “sheets” of our brains.
>
>I will not discuss these proposals here. I will limit myself to stress that all of them are affected by an unsatisfactory vagueness. In fact it is not clear when the superselection rules of (Daneri 1962) become effective, as well as when a splitting of the universe or of the brain should occur.

### Bohmian mechanics [p. 9]

>The basic idea (Bohm 1952) of this approach is that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory and that, in order to characterize the state of a system, further variables (hidden and inaccessible) are necessary. The hidden variables that supplement the wavefunction are the initial positions of the particles of the system. […] In terms of the known wavefunction at the various times one introduces a velocity field which drives the various particles. […]The theory is completely deterministic, it fully agrees with the quantum predictions concerning the probability density distributions of the positions and it claims that what the theory is about are exclusively the positions of all particles of the universe. The scheme overcomes the difficulties related to WPR and it is mathematically precise. For our purposes it is important to stress that this approach does not meet any difficulty with the psycho-physical correspondence if one accepts that our perceptions are fully determined by the locations of the particles in our brain.

### Decoherence [p. 10]

>A lot of attention (Zurek 1981; Griffiths 1984; Gell-Mann & Hartle 1990) has been paid to approaches making a precise reference to the decoherence induced on any quantum system, and in particular on macroscopic ones, by the unavoidable interaction with the environment. The idea is rather simple, and can be depicted by enriching the von Neumann chain by taking into account that the different macrostates become correlated with orthogonal states of the environment. […]
>
>Since the experimenter has no control of the degrees of freedom of the environment, i.e. of its states, he must disregard them. Doing this one ends up dealing, as in the case of Daneri and of Jauch, with a statistical mixture, precisely the one implied by WPR.
>
>This argument characterizes Zurek’s approach. Griffiths, Gell-Mann and Hartle “Decoherent Histories” scheme is a more refined approach based on analogous considerations. Some remarks are appropriate.
>
>- These approaches make clear that the unavoidable interactions with the environment and, subsequently, with the whole universe, make extremely difficult to put into evidence the superpositions of different macroscopic states. In this sense they show that the standard theory with the inconsistent WPR postulate works well, for all practical purposes.
>- It does not seem acceptable to claim that linear superposition of states corresponding to different perceptions occur but that this fact is irrelevant because each of them is associated, e.g., to a different location of a molecule of the environment (the argument actually rests entirely and simply on the orthogonality of the states of the environment).
>- The proposal deals essentially with ensembles. But in practice one mostly deals with individuals physical systems.
>- Contrary to the classical case, in quantum mechanics, different statistical ensembles may give rise to precisely the same physics. […] This being the situation, what makes legitimate to make the first choice and to ignore the possibility of a mixture of states involving the superposition of macroscopically and perceptively different states?
>
>Even the more convinced supporters of decoherence have been compelled to face this problem and have been lead to recognize (Joos & Zeh 1985) that:
>
>>“Of course, no unitary treatment of the time dependence can explain while only one of these dynamically independent components is experienced.”

### von Neumann and Wigner [p. 11]

>von Neumann himself and, subsequently, Wigner, have taken a clear cut attitude: in nature “physical processes” and “conscious acts of perception” occur and they obey different laws. In brief, they accept that quantum mechanics governs only the first set of processes. von Neumann stresses that, in his chain, the final state always refers to the act of perception of a conscious observer, a process which, in his view, is not governed by quantum mechanics but by WPR. The idea is fascinating and it has a certain consistency. Its limitation derives from the fact that it does not make precise the borderline between the two levels. As J. Bell has put it:
>
>>“What is conscious? The first living cell or a Ph.D student?”

### Collapse or GRW models [p. 11]

>Quite recently a new approach to the problem of interest has been proposed. It is based on the idea that (Bell 1990):
>
>>“Schrödinger’s equation is not always true.”
>
>One adds to the standard evolution equation nonlinear and stochastic terms which strive to induce WPR at the appropriate level, leading to states which correspond to definite macroscopic outcomes. The theory, usually referred as the GRW theory (Ghirardi 1986), is a rival theory of quantum mechanics and is experimentally testable against it. Its main merits are that it qualifies itself as a unified theory governing all natural processes, in full agreement with quantum predictions for microscopic processes and inducing the desired objectification of the properties of macroscopic systems. Let us be more precise.
>
>A first problem concerns the choice of the preferred basis: if one wants to objectify some properties, which ones have to be privileged? The natural choice is the one of the position basis, as suggested by Einstein (1926): “A macrobody must always have a quasi-sharply defined position in the objective description of reality.”
A second problem, and the more difficult, is to embody in the scheme a triggering mechanism implying that the modifications to the standard theory be absolutely negligible for microsystems while having a remarkable effect at the macroscopic level. […]
>
>It is immediate to realize that a localization, when it occurs, suppresses the linear superposition of states in which a particle is well localized at different positions separated by a distance. […]
>
>The most important feature of the model stays in the trigger mechanism. […]
>
>With these premises we can choose the values of the parameters of the theory (which Bell has considered as new constants of nature): the mean frequency of the localizations and their accuracy. In the original proposal these values have been chosen (with reference to the processes suffered by nucleons, since the frequency is proportional to the mass of the particles) to be 10-16 sec-1 and 10-5 cm. So, a microscopic system suffers a localization, on average, every hundred millions years. This is why the theory agrees to an extremely high level of accuracy with quantum mechanics for microsystems. On the other hand, due to the trigger mechanism, one of the constituents of a macroscopic system, and, correspondingly, the whole system, undergoes a localization every 10−7 seconds.
>
>Few comments are at order:
>
>- The theory allows to locate the ambiguous split between micro and macro, reversible and irreversible, quantum and classical. The transition is governed by the number of particles which are well localized at positions further apart than 10−5 cm in the two states whose coherence is going to be dynamically suppressed.
>- The theory is testable against quantum mechanics. Various proposals have been put forward (Rae 1990; Rimini 1995; Adler 2002; Marshall 2003). The tests are difficult to be performed with the present technology. The theory identifies appropriate sets of mesoscopic processes which might reveal the failure of the superposition principle.
>- Most of the physics does not depend on both parameters, but on their product. A change of one or two orders of magnitude of this value will already conflict with experimentally established facts. So, in spite of its appearing “ad hoc”, if one chooses to make objective the positions (and no other alternatives are practicable), almost no arbitrariness remains.
>
>An interesting feature deserves a comment. Let us make reference to a discretized version of the model. Suppose we are dealing with many particles and, accordingly, we can disregard Schrödinger’s evolution of the system because the dominant effect is the collapse. Suppose that we divide the universe in elementary cells of volume 10−15 cm3, the volume related to the localization accuracy.
>
>It is interesting to remark that […] if one is interested in time intervals of the order of perceptual times (i.e. about 10−2 sec) this expression implies that the universal dynamics characterizing the theory does not allow the persistence for perceptual times of a superposition of two states which differ for the fact that 1018 nucleons (a Planck’s mass) are differently located in the whole universe. This remark suggests a relation with the idea of Penrose who, to solve the measurement problem by following the quantum gravity line, has repeatedly claimed that it is the Planck mass which defines the boundary between the wavy quantum universe and the world of our definite perceptions.

### Collapse theories and definite perceptions [p. 14]

>An interesting objection to GRW has been presented (Albert & Vaidman 1989; Albert 1992). By taking advantage of the extreme sensitivity of our perceptual apparatuses, the authors have remarked that one can devise situations leading to definite perceptions which do not involve the displacement of a sufficient number of particles (such as those of a pointer) in order that the GRW mechanism enters into play.
>
>Albert and Vaidman have considered a particle […] which goes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus […]. The particle ends up in the superposition of moving along a trajectory pointing upwards and one pointing downwards. After the apparatus there is a fluorescent screen such that when it is hit by the particle at a given point, about 10 atoms with an extremely short life-time are excited and decay immediately. In this way, we produce the linear superposition of two rays originating from two points A and B, differently located on the screen.
>
>The argument goes on: due to the fact that the process is triggered by a single particle and that it involves few photons, there is no way for the GRW dynamics to induce reduction on one of the two states. On the other hand we know that, due to the sensitivity of our visual apparatus, an observer looking at the screen will have a definite perception concerning the fact that the luminous signal comes from A or from B. Accordingly, in Albert and Vaidman’s opinion, collapse theories must accept reduction by consciousness in order to account for definite perceptions by the observer.
>
>Note that since microscopically different situations usually trigger macroscopic changes in the material world, only in exceptional cases one should resort to consciousness. Apart from this fact (which has not been appropriately recognized by the above authors) we have taken the challenge represented by the smart suggestion of Albert and Vaidman. Our counterargument goes as follows:
>
>- We agree that the superposition of the considered microstates persists for the time which has to elapse before the eye is stimulated (actually it must persist because in place of observing the rays we could make them interfere, proving that the superposition is there).
>- However, to deal with the process in the spirit of the GRW theory, one has to consider all systems which enter into play (triggering particle, screen, photons and brain). A quite prudential estimate of the number of ions (Na and K ions going through the Ranvier nodes and transmitting the electrical signal to the lateral geniculate body and to the higher visual cortex) which are involved, makes perfectly reasonable (we refer the reader to (Aicardi 1991) for details) that a sufficient number of particles are displaced by a sufficient spatial amount (recall that the myelin sheet is precisely 10−5 cm thick) to satisfy the conditions under which, according to the GRW theory, the suppression of the superposition of the two signals will take place within the perception time scale.
>- We are not attaching any particular role to the conscious observer. The observer’s brain is the only system which is present in which a superposition of two states involving different locations of a large number of particles occur. As such, it is the only place where the reduction can and actually must occur according to the theory. If in place of the eye of a conscious observer one puts in front of the photon beams a spark chamber or a device leading to the displacement of a macroscopic pointer, reduction will equally take place. In the example, the human nervous system is simply a physical system, a specific assembly of particles, which performs the same function as one of these devices, if no other device interacts with the photons before the human observer does.
>
>Before concluding we feel the need of a specification. The above analysis could be taken as indicating a naive and oversimplified attitude towards the deep problem of the mind-brain correspondence. There is no claim and no presumption that the GRW theory allows a physicalistic explanation of conscious perceptions. We only point out that, for what we know about the purely physical aspects of the process, before the nervous pulse reaches the higher visual cortex, the conditions guaranteeing, according to collapse models, the suppression of one of the two electric pulses are verified. In brief, a consistent use of the dynamical reduction mechanism accounts for the definiteness of the conscious perception, even in the peculiar situation devised by Albert and Vaidman.
