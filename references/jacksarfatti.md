## Retrocausality and signal nonlocality in consciousness and cosmology <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Journal of Cosmology, vol. 14, 2011*

### Abstract [p. 1]

>I conjecture that the intrinsic conscious mental field is analogous to a hologram […]. Therefore, different parts of the brain can locally decode messages from other distant parts without having to wait for classical electrical and chemical signal keys to move slower than light. The coherent order parameter landscape is phase and amplitude locked into the distributed pattern of the electrical and chemical signals both for sensory input and motor output in a set of creative feedback-control loops. The imprinting action of the electrical and chemical signal patterns on the intrinsically mental landscape excites our inner conscious qualia and explains the “binding problem” of how the conscious mind has an undivided wholeness. The piloting reaction of those excitations in the mental landscape back on the electrical and chemical signal pattern is our volition in which thought is expressed in our motor behavior. The application of similar ideas to the cosmological dark energy and arrow of time problems is also discussed. Indeed, I suggest that the dark energy accelerating the universe is advanced Hawking-Unruh black body radiation from our future observer-dependent cosmological event horizon.


### Retrocausality and signal nonlocality in consciousness and cosmology [p. 2]

>There is now ample independent reproducible evidence in many published papers (Bem 2011; Bierman 2008; Libet, 1979; Radin, 2004) for back-from-the-future “presponse” in human consciousness (Stapp, 1996). Yakir Aharonov (1998) in his back-from-the-future version of quantum theory argues that unlike classical mechanics, in quantum mechanics the initial pre-selected and final post-selected conditions are truly independent. […] Aharonov shows with actual experiments using weak measurements that the statistical ensemble expectation values need two quantum state vectors instead of the usual one. […] Aharonov and his students speculate that a final condition in our future retro-causally influences the past evolution of life on Earth. On the other hand, Michael Nauenberg wrote:

Their unphysical description of the measurement process, leads them to the false conclusion that ‘quantum mechanics offers a place to specify both an initial and an independent final state’, and to such outlandish statements like ‘that quantum mechanics lets one impose … a putative final state of the universe’.”(Nauenberg 2011)

>Aharonov’s theory is still limited by what Abner Shimony calls “passion at a distance” aka signal locality. Signal locality precludes using nonlocal quantum entanglement as a stand-alone communication channel. This means that any attempt to encode and send a message from one part of an entangled system to another part will only show random noise at that second part. Decoding the nonlocally entangled stored message always requires an additional classical signal or “key” to break the code. Brian Josephson (1991) and myself (1998) independently suggested ways out of this involving generalizing quantum theory with “signal nonlocality”. […] Antony Valentini published detailed formal papers asserting that “sub-quantal non-equilibrium” of Bohm’s “hidden variables” permits signal nonlocality with profound consequences for quantum cryptography (Valentini 2002). In addition, the discovery of dark energy accelerating the expansion of our observable universe is evidence for the idea that we are retro-causal back-from-the-future hologram image computations from our future cosmological event horizon (Davis 2003) whose increasing area-entropy from the moment of inflation almost trivially explains the irreversible arrow of time.

>I assume here as a fact that we have unconscious neurological responses before the external stimuli. This cannot be explained by orthodox quantum theory because this presponse is non-random violating the no-signaling with entanglement theorem based on unitary time evolution of the quantum wave function and the usual Born probability interpretation. […]

>Furthermore, I suggest that all living matter is “nonequilibrium” in Valentini’s “subquantal” sense within Bohm’s ontological interpretation of quantum theory. The latter pictures real electrons and other particles on definite spacetime trajectories influenced by the nonlocal context-dependent quantum potential as well as the classical local gauge electro-weak-strong forces. Therefore, we can apply ordinary non-equilibrium statistical mechanics because the “hidden variables” are not really “hidden” at all but correspond pretty much to our usual classical pictures contrary to Bohr’s position in his debate with Einstein. All the quantum weirdness is in the quantum potential Q for fermions and its generalization to boson field theory. Orthodox quantum theory corresponding to “subquantal thermodynamic equilibrium” of the hidden variable particles corresponds to a “fragile” quantum potential Q. “Fragile” in this context was coined by Bohm and Hiley in their book “The Undivided Universe”. It means that the hidden variables are test particles that are piloted by Q, but do not directly back-react on it. Such direct back-reaction would permit stabilizing feedback-control loops between the entangled particles and their shared Q. Pumping by an external flow of energy should establish sub-quantal nonequilibrium and long-range coherence analogous to a laser above threshold. The material hidden variables are then no longer passive test particles at the mercy of their intrinsically thoughtlike Q, but modify it whilst being moved by it. This change in the shape of the Q landscape is the origin of all conscious qualia. (Stapp 1996) That’s the model. […]

>When we have spontaneous broken ground state symmetry in a complex system the local order parameter is a giant coherent “one particle” (BEC) field in ordinary space. I mean the ground state of quasi-particle excitations of the brain material probably at the level of the single electron dipoles inside the protein dimers of the microtubules in the now well-known model of Stuart Hameroff (Hameroff, 1987).

>Retrocausality was found in the physics of radiation reaction by Dirac in the 1930s and applied by Wheeler and Feynman (1945) for classical electrodynamics and to quantum theory. The imposition of a perfect total future absorber for all light ensures that the world looks as if there is only past cause and future effect. Hoyle and Narlikar (1995) applied the Wheeler-Feynman idea even further to quantum theory as did Cramer (1986). Hoyle and Narlikar also applied it to cosmology. Of particular interest is their proof that the steady state cosmology obeys the perfect total future absorber final boundary condition. All of this was before the discovery of the gravitationally repulsive dark energy that is about 73% of all the stuff in our part of the multiverse that causes the expansion of 3D space to speed up rather than slow down.

>However, this black body Unruh radiation that matches the dark energy accelerating our universe must be advanced Wheeler-Feynman radiation from our future event horizon arriving at the Type 1a supernovae in our past light cone for reasons given below. It cannot be coming from our past particle horizon. […]

>This is why I predict that all attempts to detect real dark matter particles in the LHC, in deep mines etc. will fail as a matter of fundamental principle. Looking for dark matter particles is like looking for the motion of the Earth through the Galilean group aether with a Michelson-Morley interferometer. So far, all attempts to detect WIMPs et-al have, and will I suspect, continue to fail. […]

>Our observable universe has both an observer-dependent past particle horizon that is the future light cone of the moment of inflation, and a future event horizon that is the past light cone of infinite proper time that is a finite Penrose conformal time (Tamara Davis 2005). […] The hologram screen cannot be our past particle horizon because its area is too small where our past light cone intercepts it. Therefore, the retarded dark energy density would be too large since it is proportional to the inverse area of the horizon. Thus, the hologram screen cosmic computer generating all material fields must be our future event horizon in my opinion. The increasing to saturation area of our approaching future 2D horizon is the total thermodynamic entropy of our observable universe if we are back-from-the-future 3D hologram images. The universe is stranger than we imagined, though not stranger than we can imagine. I am obviously more optimistic than Birkbeck College’s J.D. Bernal who thought that the universe might be stranger than we can ever imagine.
