## Retrocausation in quantum mechanics and the effects of minds on the creation of physical reality <a name="arkhe"></a>
*AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 1841, 2017*

### Abstract [p. 1]

>The key step in the creation of quantum mechanics during 1925 by Heisenberg and his colleagues was to recognize and emphasize the essential dynamical role of mental properties in the creation of our mental empirical findings. This basic feature of quantum mechanics was cast into rigorous mathematical form by John von Neumann, and was made a central feature of contemporary relativistic quantum field theory by the work of Tomonaga and Schwinger. That theory is causally strictly forward in time. But it is explained here how it can nevertheless accommodate the seeming backward-in-time causal effects reported by D.J. Bem, and many others, by means of a slight biasing of the famous Born Rule. The purpose of this communication is to explain how those reported retrocausal findings can be explained by a strictly forward-in-time and nearly orthodox causal dynamics that, however, permits the Born Rule to be slightly biased under certain conditions.

### Introduction [p. 1]

>In the science-based effort to understand the nature of the reality of which we are parts, a key step was the creation of quantum mechanics in 1925 by Heisenberg and colleagues. […] This new theory was built around the idea that the conscious thoughts of observing agents enter in an essential way into the behavior of the macroscopic aspects of their physically described brains and bodies. But in spite of the huge success of this quantum theoretical approach, most contemporary mainstream scientists and philosophers of science adhere to the physicalist doctrine, which claims that insofar as we are interested in the large-scale behavior of systems, including the bodies and brains of us human observers, we can assume that, just as in classical physics, our mental aspects are causally inert by-products of dynamically self-sufficient physically described activities, and can therefore be excluded from the effective dynamical description of the macroscopic aspects of the physically described world. In this paper a feasible experiment is described that can shed important light on this basic question of the role of mental realities in the unfolding of the observed physically described world.

>This proposed experiment is a variation of the well-known “erotic picture” retrocausation experiment designed and executed by Daryl J. Bem. In this experiment a human subject, often (and herein) called “Alice”, is seated in front of a screen showing two curtains, and is told that behind one of them lies an interesting picture, and behind the other lies a boring blank wall; and that she should choose (i.e., guess), on the basis of her “hunch” or “feeling”, the curtain behind which the interesting picture lies. After a delay, that chosen curtain will be removed, so that Alice can see what lies behind it. The other curtain is left in place. Soon after her choice of curtain is made and recorded, two well-tested 50-50 random number generators (RNGs) are activated. Their outcomes control mechanisms that, in each trial, place either an erotic picture or a non erotic picture, or an image of a blank wall behind each of the two curtains. Then later, at the end of the trial, Alice looks at what lies behind the curtain she has chosen. The set-up is such that there is, by virtue of the known properties of the RNGs, a 50-50 chance that if she sees a picture, not a wall, she will see an erotic picture, not a non-erotic picture. But the reported empirical finding is that Alice tends to choose an erotic picture instead of a non-erotic picture roughly 53% of the time, in a long sequence of trials.
>
>The simplest classical explanation (apart from faulty experimental design or execution) would seem to be that the RNGs are somehow producing a physical effect that acts backward-in-time and influences Alice’s earlier choice of curtain–in order to tend to make that chosen curtain be the one behind which the erotic picture will later appear. Such a backward-in-time effect is appropriately called “retrocausation”
>
>An alternative but non-retrocausal possible explanation of this unexpected correlation (of Alice’s earlier choice of screen with, effectively, the later random choices of the RNGs) is that this correlation, like everything in the quantum universe, is due to features of the underlying quantum process of the creation of the unfolding of reality. I shall, in this connection, in agreement with Leibnitz, accept the “Principle of Sufficient Reason”, which asserts that nothing can happen without some reason for it to be what it turns out to be, rather than something else: i.e., a determination of something from nothing at all is, according to this principle, simply not possible! A sudden definiteness of something previously indefinite cannot simply pop out of nothing at all. A definiteness must be rooted in something sufficient to make it what it is, not something else!
>
>According to orthodox quantum mechanics, certain choices of what an observer will experience are governed by a purely statistical rule called Born Rule. The principle of sufficient reason asserts that no such choice can be made strictly randomly on the basis of absolutely nothing at all – i.e., completely “out of the blue”! According to that principle, the “fact” that the workings of Nature result in the observed picture’s being more often “erotic” than “non-erotic” must stem from some sufficient reason.
>
>We human beings create during the course of our lives our own personal values, which influence, often unconsciously, our subsequent and otherwise “free” choices of how to behave. Quantum theory allows for this dependence of our own “free” choices of probing actions upon these essentially mental realities. In the quantum world our minds are enabled, by the asserted mind-brain connection, to affect our actions via our personal-value-influenced choices of our physical probing actions!
>
>Orthodox quantum mechanics, as described by von Neumann, and extended by Tomonaga and Schwinger to Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, has, in addition to the “free choices” of probing questions by observers also associated “random” choices of responses made by Nature. Hence a key question arises: “What, in the end, determines Nature’s individual ‘random’ quantum choices?” […]
>
>The purpose of this communication is to describe a proposed feasible experiment, based on Bem’s “erotic picture” experiments, here assumed empirically veridical, that could shed important light on this basic question by lending empirical support to the (nearly) orthodox quantum mechanical conception of Nature, which involves essential dynamical influences of mind upon macroscopic brain dynamics – in contrast to the contemporary mainstream physicalist approach that claims that a classical-physics-based theory that excludes macroscopic effects of mind upon brain is completely adequate. […]
>
>According to orthodox quantum mechanics, the choice of what an observer will experience is determined in the end by a choice on the part of Nature that is governed by a statistical rule called Born Rule. […] According to that principle, the fact that Nature, under the conditions imposed by the Bem experiment, chooses “erotic” more often than “non-erotic” must stem from some “sufficient reason”. Such a reason could be, for example, a dependence of Nature’s response upon the character or potency of the mental state of the observer whose probing query instigates the collapse process that is the signature feature of orthodox quantum mechanics.
>
>Such a biasing of Nature’s choice by the character of the mental state of the observer would be an empirical finding of immense practical and theoretical importance. Or perhaps the biasing is a consequence of Nature’s favoring worlds that, for example, promote the preservation of life. Further experimentation could explore such issues. The experiment proposed here speaks only to the central question of whether, as specified by orthodox quantum mechanics, the intervention of a human observer can produce a dynamical collapse of the state of the observed system that is profoundly different from what is produced by the unitary (Schrödinger-equation-type) evolution of the full physically described system of observed system, measuring system, and environment? Does observation by a conscious human observer have a collapsing effect that an interaction with a purely mechanical system lacks? Do mental realities matter?

### Orthodox quantum description of the Bem experiment [p. 3]

>According to Tomonaga and Schwinger based relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), the evolution of the physically described world, represented by the quantum mechanical state of the universe, is strictly forward in time. […] Thus we have an ordered sequence of space-time universes, each containing a 3D space-like surface “now”. Relative to this surface, along which a collapse occurs, there are two different “pasts”: the “actual past” that was there before the collapse, and the “effective past” that is defined as the backward-in-time continuation via a relevant Schrödinger equation, of the immediate future that exists just after the collapse. Thus the “effective past” keeps changing even though the causal dynamical process is strictly forward-in-time.
>
>This is the orthodox temporal structure defined by the relativistic quantum field theory developed by Tomonaga and Schwinger. There is no actual backward-in-time action, but merely a sequence of piecewise increments to the expanding past. In the Bem experiment each collapse can be influenced by the state of mind of the associated observer, and by the current physical state of the universe, and by the reasons behind the choice made by Nature, but not by the yet-to-be-determined future.

### The role of conscious minds in the determination of the course of physical events: a proposed crucial experiment [p. 4]

>If Charlie were to be replaced by, say, the IBM smart (but presumed mindless) computer “Watson” then, according to the orthodox theory, no quantum collapse would occur. Indeed, an experiment without conscious Charlie, but with a mindless Watson instead, is roughly equivalent to the normal Bem experiment itself. That is because the macroscopic action of the RNG and the associated recording devices is effectively already including a simple mechanical observer. So unless the high complexity of the “observer” is the essential cause of the collapse, instead of a mind per se as the orthodox theory asserts, then the usual Bem experiment is already sufficient to cover the case in which conscious Charlie is replaced by a mindless computer. According to the orthodox theory it is “mind” that matters: both the minds of conscious beings, and a capital MIND that can be gratuitously associated with Nature’s choice of response, which is not deemed by orthodox theory to be determined by purely physical causes alone.
