### The end of time [p. 347]

>So, for complex events, time does have an arrow. Most series of events occur in one direction, but not the other. For just about everything in the world around you, you can easily tell the difference between forward-in-time and backward-in-time. But the lesson of nineteenth-century physics is that this difference is a matter of probabilities, not absolutes. One direction might be quite likely, the other direction incredibly, ridiculously unlikely. Yet unlikely is not quite the same as impossible. So Newtonian time-reversal invariance is saved, even if it doesn't seem to have much to do with the world that we experience. […]
>
>The second law of thermodynamics relates probabilities to time’s arrow. It says that any system left to itself (free of outside influences) will tend toward greater disorder. There are more ways to be disorderly than to be orderly. Disorder is therefore more probable than order. If the system is quite complex, the probability of disorder exceeds the probability of order by an enormous factor – so enormous that, for all practical purposes, there is only one direction of change (for an isolated system): from order to disorder. […]
>
>The intriguing thought that follows from these considerations is that we are aware of a one-way flow of time only because we are ourselves complex systems interacting with other complex systems. We remember the past and not the future not because there is any fundamental asymmetry in time but because of the overwhelming disparity between the likely and the unlikely in everything that we are and do and see.
>
>Back when Dick Feynman and I were talking about electrons moving with equal ease backward and forward in time, we realized that such a way of thinking made sense because of the extreme simplicity of the electron. You can tell by looking into a person’s face something about what that person has been through. You cannot tell anything about an electron’s history by looking at it. Every electron is exactly like every other electron, unscarred by its past, not blessed with a memory – of either the human or computer variety. The electron pays for its freedom to move forward and backward in time by remembering neither future nor past. We remember the past and are trapped in one-way motion through time.
>
>In speaking of nineteenth-century physics, I am speaking really of the sciences of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Developments in those fields showed how the statistics of large numbers can convert the time-symmetric laws that govern simple events into the time-asymmetric laws that we see governing complex events. […]
>
>For more than half of the twentieth century, it appeared that time symmetry in the small remained the rule, with time asymmetry being an artifact of complexity. As particles were discovered, as nuclei were explored, as quantum electrodynamics evolved, at first nothing marred this picture of perfect time symmetry for all basic laws. In the work that Feynman and I did on action at a distance, for instance, we found that the apparent one-way flow of radiation – forward in time, not backward – could be entirely accounted for by the large-scale distribution of absorbing mass in the universe, lots of it. It required no time asymmetry in the fundamental laws of electrodynamics. Then in 1964, James Cronin (now at the University of Chicago) and Val Fitch, with their colleagues James Christenson and René Turlay, discovered that time-reversal invariance fails for the decay of the K meson, or kaon. Here, for the first time, was an example of time asymmetry at the elementary level of single particles, not the level of complex systems. […]

>No, it isn’t turtles all the way down. To be sure, the observed mechanical properties of substances have been explained in terms of atoms, and atoms have been explained in terms of electrons and protons and neutrons, and protons and neutrons have been explained in terms of quarks. There are a few turtles standing on other turtles. But we have many reasons to believe that the layers of explanation do not continue indefinitely. For one reason, the bits of matter cease to be distinct as we go deeper. No two pencil leads are identical, but every atom of carbon 12 (the principal constituent of graphite) is identical to every other atom of carbon 12. If the number of layers (the number of turtles) were infinite, Why would an atom of carbon not be as complex as a pencil lead? For another reason, quantum theory tells us that things get more chaotic, not more orderly, as we go deeper. The ultimate basis of reality is not likely to be found in the unpredictable fluctuations that characterize the smallest dimensions, the deepest layers. How can a turtle composed of seething quantum foam, in which even space and time cease to have meaning, be patiently holding up more solid turtles?
>
>Time itself, I have come to believe, participates in the general complexity, in the fluctuations, in the uncertainty. The smooth flow of time – or our smooth passage through it – is an illusion that is shattered when we look at short-enough intervals of time, and when we ask about time at the moment of the Big Bang, at a moment of gravitational collapse, at the moment of the Big Crunch.
>
>Students and others often ask what existed before the Big Bang. To say that we don’t know is not to say enough. Even to say that we have no way of knowing is not enough. We really have to say that space and time came into existence, along with matter and energy and the laws of physics, at the moment of the Big Bang. If the universe expands to a maximum size, starts contracting, and eventually collapses to a fiery death – a fate that seems likely to me and to some other theorists, even though the evidence for it is still weak – then time, and space too, will end in this Big Crunch. I can reach no conclusion other than this: there was no “before” before the Big Bang, and there will be no “after” after the Big Crunch.
>
>But we don’t have to look back to the Big Bang to speak of the beginning of time or look forward to a Big Crunch to speak of the end of time. Black holes are more than likely coming into existence throughout the universe right now, and some may be evaporating. Every black hole brings an end to time and space and the laws of physics in itself as surely as the Big Crunch will bring an end to the universe as a whole. […]
>
>Theory suggests also that black holes of incredibly small size, at the scale of the so-called Planck length, are forming and dissolving all the time by the trillion, within the dimensions of every elementary particle. At that scale, with spacetime churned into quantum foam, space and time in fact lose their meaning. When we blend the two greatest theories of the twentieth century, quantum theory and general relativity, we have to conclude that time is a secondary concept, a derived concept. It has meaning only at a scale large compared with the Planck length and only well away from black holes, the Big Bang, or the Big Crunch. It is not a river that rolls inexorably forward. It is not a lake across which we glide. It is more to be compared with temperature or with entropy, concepts that take their meaning only when large numbers of particles are involved. Time, we must conclude, is of statistical origin, valid only when dimensions are large enough and when conditions are not too extreme.
>
>According to a graffito that I once saw in the men’s room of the Pecan Street Cafe in Austin, Texas, “Time is nature’s way to keep everything from happening all at once.” Maybe that’s as good a definition as any. Time is, in fact, an immensely complex idea that sits at the core of critical unanswered questions about the universe and existence, questions I can’t stop pondering.
>
>By 1970, I had become convinced not only that black holes are an inevitable consequence of general relativity theory and that they are likely to exist in profusion in the universe, but also that their existence implies the mutability of physical law. If time can end in a black hole, if space can be crumpled to nothingness in its center, if the number of particles within a black hole has no meaning, then Why should we believe that there is anything special, anything unique, about the laws of physics that we discover and apply? These laws must have come into existence with the Big Bang as surely as space and time did.
>
>Let me shift to a biological analogy. Life, we have every reason to believe, arose from nonlife. Why did it take the forms it has taken and evolve as it has? There is surely not one path only that it could follow. Chance played a major role. Chance that the life we are familiar with happened to get started on this particular Planet near this particular sun. Chance that a moon provided tides, and a rotating Earth provided changes of wind and weather. We have no reason to believe that life on some other Planet near some other star has much in common with life that we know here – and every reason to think that even on our own Planet, life could very well have followed a quite different evolutionary track. Referring to one of his detractors, Charles Darwin said, shortly after publication of The Origin of Species, “[The astronomer Sir John] Herschel says my book is ‘the law of higgledy-piggledy’.”
>
>My conception of the origin of physical law in the Big Bang is similar. By whatever higgledy-piggledy chance, space arose, time arose, laws of physics arose. Perhaps, as with the origin of life on Earth, there were limits to what might arise. It wasn’t “anything goes.” But it also wasn’t “only one thing goes.” And, just as life arose from nonlife on Earth, something arose from nothing in the universe. That “nothing” from which something arose should not, however, be confused with the emptiness of a vacuum. It is nothing in a profounder sense. It is nothingness. Why is the universe what it is? What other way might it have been? These are questions that have not been answered, indeed scarcely addressed. […]
>
>In these later years, I have dared to think about and write about and ask about the physical world in terms that some of my colleagues consider outside the scope of science – science as it is now accepted, defined, and practiced.
>
>Is the universe a self-excited circuit, made real by observation? Does physics rest on yes-no bits of information? Do the laws of physics come into existence in the higgledy-piggledy of the Big Bang, and are they extinguished in the Big Crunch? Is time a secondary, derived concept? Can the laws of physics mutate in the way that living organisms mutate? What deeper principle will one day make quantum theory seem inevitable and natural? Will a comprehensive view of the physical world come not from the bottom up – from an endless tower of turtles standing one on the other – but from a grand pattern linking all of its parts? I do not apologize for questions like these and hope that they are not the result merely of a weakening brain. The student of physics – the future researcher – needs to be stimulated not only by learning of recent solid advances in the subject but also by hearing speculative thoughts on where the subject might be headed. Einstein liked to say that he had earned the right to make mistakes. I hope that I have earned the right to speculate on the future shape of the subject to which I have devoted my life.
>
>I think back to Bernard de Spinoza in the seventeenth century; to Bernhard Riemann, William Kingdon Clifford, and Ernst Mach in the nineteenth; and to Niels Bohr in the twentieth. Spinoza’s belief in the harmony, the beauty, and the ultimate comprehensibility of nature had a profound effect on Einstein, What else could have led Einstein to express his sympathy for the Good Lord if general relativity proved to be wrong? Through Einstein and his followers – Dirac, Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman, and others – it has become an article of faith in twentieth-century physics that if a theory is simple enough, comprehensive enough, “beautiful” enough, it must be right.
>
>More than half a century before Einstein, the great German mathematician Bernhard Riemann dared to speculate that the geometry of physical space need not be God-given Euclidean space, but could well be some other geometry and should be determined by experiment, not by hypothesis. Williarn Kingdon Clifford imagined that space could be a dynamic substance capable of deformation that could propagate like waves. Later, Mach postulated that inertia “here” results from mass “there.” Einstein brought all of these speculations into the realm of “real” science. And it was not more coincidence. He was influenced by the thinking, at least, of Riemann and Mach.
>
>Niels Bohr, as creative a scientist as any in the twentieth century, dared to speculate, too, on the meaning of the quantum, on the role of the observer in determining reality. I was privileged to work with Bohr on a topic of startling immediacy, nuclear fission, and also to watch him wrestle with the paradoxes of the quantum as he looked toward the physics of the future might look like. “Wrestle” was a term he liked. Physics was a battle. Nature was a worthy opponent. I have unquestionably been influenced by Bohr in the ways that I approach both the immediate, where, little by little, the frontier gets nudged back, and the hazy future, where questions far outnumber answers, where only intuition and vision guide progress. […]
>
>Finally, I dared to put before the students two of my favorite questions: How come existence? and its subsidiary, How come the quantum? I hardly expected any student to say, “Aha! Those are the questions that I want to work on.” As to my colleagues’ reactions: Well, the questions are not for them. My goal was only to plant an idea deep in the minds of the students, an idea that might find some way to flower five or ten or fifty years later. […]

>But I am still too busy, too busy searching, to spend much time looking back. As Niels Bohr’s friend Piet Hein puts it in another of his grooks,
