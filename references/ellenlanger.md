### A mindful alternative to the mind/body problem

>The age-old “mind/body"” problem (i.e. How can something non-material, such as a thought, affect the material body?) continues to challenge philosophers and scientists alike. The implicit assumption, however – that mind and body are separate entities – may be the problem that needs to be addressed. From Plotinus to Nagarjuna to Spinoza, a long line of thinkers through the ages have proposed that mind and body are but two sides of the same coin. That many such thinkers were often dwelling over concerns of philosophy or religion when they developed this idea may unfortunately have caused this insight to be met with suspicion, even outright derision, by the modern scientific academe. Current findings from fields as diverse as social psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive science, however, indicate that the tides of popular sentiment may again be turning. […]

>Today it is more or less taken for granted that mind effects body although the pathways are still unknown but mind-body monism is not accepted by the modern scientific world because pathways are still unknown. […]

>Mindfulness is defined as an active state of mind characterized by novel distinction–drawing that results in being 1) situated in the present; 2) sensitive to context and perspective and 3) guided (but not governed) by rules and routines. The phenomenological experience of mindfulness is the felt experience of engagement. […]

>Mindlessness, by contrast, is defined as an inactive state of mind characterized by reliance on distinctions and categories drawn in the past. Here 1) the past over-determines the present; 2) we are trapped in a single perspective but oblivious to that entrapment; 3) we are insensitive to context; and 4) rules and routines govern rather than guide our behavior. Moreover, mindlessness typically comes about by default rather than by design. […]

>Mindfulness allows for doubt and that allows for choice and thus free will. Being in a mindful state, removed from rigid routines, introduces possibilities from which one can make alternative choices and thus exercise their free will. When mindless, by contrast, our behavior is predetermined by the past, closing us off to choice and new possibilities. […] Science becomes mindless when we automatically begin to conflate precision with certainty. Certainties lead to mindlessness; when we think we know, there is no reason to find out. Too often scientists observe a phenomenon, create a theory to explain it and then collect data to prove their theory. Not surprisingly, confirmation is found. […]

>This illusory sense of knowing is pervasive, extending even to the point where we misconstrue the nature of our own mental processes. What are we actually doing when we hold a certain concept in our mind’s eye? Picture a car, for example. Now, start taking away individual elements that seem essential to the “car-ness” of it all, and ask yourself if you’d still know it’s a car. A car without wheels? Still a car. […] Wittgenstein (1953) famously performed a similar dissection of conceptual categories, effectively demonstrating (in his case, with the concept of “game”) the inherent illusion that our mental categories for things are actually based upon some identifiable set of core features. So what is it that makes a car a car? Not much, as it turns out.
>
>Recent findings in the field of cognitive neuropsychology have begun to indicate that this assertion – that conceptual categories lack inherent unifying features – is backed by more than just sound logic. Barsalou (2009) and Wilson-Mendelhall et al. (2010) have established that the brain doesn’t actually use a set of core concepts to define mental categories of objects and phenomena – rather, our thought processes remain in a perpetual state of collection, assessment, and reaction to incoming information. It is only at the point of higher-level cognitive processes that we begin to grow lazy and assume that all examples of cars have some inherent “car-ness” about them (Or, for that matter, that all instances of fear, or anger, or pride, must necessarily be connected by some unifying element). In reality, the idea of “car” (or “fear”, or any other concept) is actually represented in our brains as a loose amalgam of instances (this morning on the way to work in traffic, on a showroom floor, in a junkyard), specific examples (a smartcar, a station wagon, a jeep), functions (creating momentum, providing shelter, controlling climate), and other characteristics of certain objects that we learn at some point to clump together. In short, there’s no core element that makes a car a car every time, all the time. Mindfulness requires that we engage the world with this same degree of dynamism and flexibility. […]

>More important to the present discussion is recent work that follows up on research originally conducted in 1981. The idea was and is deceptively simple. Mind and body are just words, concepts to which we rigidly adhere. Consider artificial boundaries like North vs South Korea or old (>65) vs. young (<65), where the concepts may have been mindfully generated initially but then took on a life of their own.

>What would happen, we asked, if we got rid of the distinction between mind and body? If we put the mind and body back together so to speak, then wherever the mind is, so too would be the body. Within this understanding there is no reason to search for mediating mechanisms. Whatever is going on at the level of the brain is happening simultaneously with the thought and is just another level of analysis.
