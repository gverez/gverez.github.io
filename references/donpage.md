## Consciousness and the quantum <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Journal of Cosmology, vol. 14, 2011*

### Abstract [p. 1]

>Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism is a framework for relating consciousness to a quantum universe. It states that each conscious perception has a measure that is given by the expectation value of a corresponding quantum “awareness operator” in a fixed quantum state of the universe. The measures can be interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for a large set of perceptions that all actually exist with varying degrees of reality, so detailed theories within this framework are testable. The measures are not propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is nothing indeterministic in this framework, and no free will in the incompatibilistic sense. As conscious perceptions are determined by the awareness operators and the quantum state, they are epiphenomena. No fundamental relation is postulated between different perceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious experience and thus not in direct contact with any other), so SQM or MS, a variant of Everett’s “many-worlds” framework, is a “many-perceptions” framework but not a “many-minds” framework.


### Consciousness and the quantum [p. 2]

>Whatever we cannot understand in terms of the simple, elegant, precise elements of our mathematical theories, we tend to dismiss as less real.
>
>In particular, I personally regard my own first-person subjective experience of consciousness as overwhelming evidence of its existence, but its apparent complexity, inelegance, and imprecision often seems to lead many physicists to dismiss it as less real than, say, elementary particles, spacetime, or quantum states. I am not at all decrying simplicity, elegance, and precision, which I do take to be extremely important, but I also do not wish to dismiss such a central feature of our experience as consciousness. […]
>
>Although we cannot be certain that our universe really is quantum, such a hypothesis helps explain so much of both our present theories and our observations that I shall take it as one of my central working hypotheses, along with the hypothesis of the existence of conscious perceptions. […]
>
>Here I wish to describe and explore a framework I have developed for relating consciousness and the quantum, which I have called Sensible Quantum Mechanics (Page 1995) or Mindless Sensationalism (Page 2003). I should emphasize that this is so far just a framework, since the details to make it into a proper precise theory are not yet known. But even just the framework itself has various consequences that may be explored.
>
>Because Sensible Quantum Mechanics builds upon quantum theory, I should first say what I regard that pillar to be. I regard the essence of quantum theory to be a C\*-algebra of quantum operators and a quantum state that gives expectation values to each operator.
>
>I cannot go into precise details here, but let me give a crude description of these elements. Quantum operators are mathematical entities that may be adjoined, multiplied by complex numbers, added together, or multiplied together to give other operators. […] An operator A might represent the position of a particle, and B might represent its momentum, but for the general structure we do not need to assign specific meanings to the operators.
>
>A quantum state may be regarded as a positive linear functional on the quantum operators, a rule for assigning a complex number to each quantum operator that is called its expectation value in that quantum state. […]
>
>Quantum theory is often regarded as having other basic elements, but I shall regard them as either being part of this basic formalism or as not really being a necessary part of quantum theory. For example, often one talks about the time evolution of a quantum state, but one can reformulate this into the Heisenberg picture in which the quantum state stays fixed and the operators change with time, and then one can re-interpret the time dependence of each operator as representing a whole family of operators, each labeled by a time parameter in addition to other labels of what the operators are. The dynamics of the operators in the usual approach would expressed in terms of the algebra of all the operators in all the families labeled by the time parameter and by the other labels. In this view, there would be nothing fundamentally special about time; it would just be one of many labels for the operators.
>
>The other pillar of Sensible Quantum Mechanics is consciousness. I shall assume here that there is a countable discrete set M of all possible conscious experiences or perceptions p. By a “conscious experience,” I mean all that one is consciously aware of or consciously experiencing at once. Lockwood (2003) has called this a “phenomenal perspective” or “maximal experience” or “conscious state.” It could also be expressed as a total “raw feel” that one has at once.
>
>Because I regard the basic conscious entities to be the conscious experiences themselves, which might crudely be called sensations if one does not restrict the meaning of this word to be the conscious responses only to external stimuli, and because I doubt that these conscious experiences are arranged in any strictly defined sequences that one might define to be minds if they did exist, my framework has sensations without minds and hence may be labeled Mindless Sensationalism (Page 2003). In this way the framework of Mindless Sensationalism proposed here is a particular manifestation of Hume’s ideas (Hume 1988), that “what we call a mind, is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations, and supposed, though falsely, to be endowed with a perfect simplicity and identity”, and that the self is “nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions”. As he explains in the Appendix, “When I turn my reflexion on myself, I never can perceive this self without some one or more perceptions; nor can I ever perceive any thing but the perceptions. This is the composition of these, therefore, which forms the self.” (Here I should note that what Hume calls a perception may be only one component of the “phenomenal perspective” or “maximal experience” (Lockwood 1989) that I have been calling a perception or conscious experience p, so one of my p’s can include “one or more perceptions” in Hume’s sense.)
>
>I should also emphasize that by a conscious experience, I mean the phenomenal, first-person, “internal” subjective experience, and not the unconscious “external” physical processes in the brain that accompany these subjective phenomena. In his first chapter, Chalmers (1996) gives an excellent discussion of the distinction between the former, which he calls the phenomenal concept of mind, and the latter, which he calls the psychological concept of mind. In his language, what I mean by a conscious experience (and by other approximate synonyms that I might use, such as perception or sensation or awareness) is the phenomenal concept, and not the psychological one.
>
>The next idea is that not all possible conscious perceptions p occur equally, but that there is a normalized measure w associated with each one (a nonnegative real number which sums to unity when one adds up the values for all the p’s in the full set M). This measure in some sense gives the level or degree of reality that the conscious perception p has. Perceptions with large measures have high degrees of reality, whereas perceptions with very low measures have tiny degrees of reality and effectively can be ignored. One can also say that the weight w is analogous to the probability for the conscious experience p, but it is not to be interpreted as the probability for the bare existence of p, since any conscious experience p exists (is actually experienced) if its weight is positive. Rather, w is to be interpreted as being proportional to the probability of getting this particular experience if a random selection were made. […]
>
>Finally, Sensible Quantum Mechanics assumes the connection between consciousness and the quantum in the form that for each conscious perception p, there is an associated quantum “awareness operator”, and that the measure for the conscious perception p is the expectation value, in the quantum state of the universe, of the corresponding experience operator. […]
>
>Of course, the Psycho-Physical Parallelism Axiom, like the Quantum World Axiom, is here also deliberately vague as to the form of the awareness operators because I do not have a detailed theory of consciousness, but only a framework for fitting it with quantum theory. My suggestion is that a theory of consciousness that is not inconsistent with bare quantum theory should be formulated within this framework. I am also suspicious of any present detailed theory that purports to say precisely under what conditions in the quantum world consciousness occurs, since it seems that we simply don’t know yet. […]
>
>Since all conscious perceptions p with w > 0 really occur in the framework of Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism, it is completely deterministic if the quantum state and the awareness operators are determined: there are no random or truly probabilistic elements in SQM or MS. Neither is there any free will in the incompatibilist sense, and consciousness may be viewed as an epiphenomenon (Page 1995, 2003). […] One can use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the theory, given the observation or conscious perception. […] In this way different SQM or MS theories are testable. […]
>
>A major problem at the frontier of theoretical cosmology is essentially to develop one or more theories that give the measures w for conscious perceptions, except that most theorists are hesitant to focus on conscious perceptions and hence ask for the probability of an observation. […] It is usually left rather vague what is supposed to constitute an observation. […]
>
>Quantum theories of this generalized form (whether or not an observation is taken to be a conscious perception) can be considered to have three parts: (1) the algebra of the full set of quantum operators, (2) the quantum state, and (3) the particular operators for each observation (or for each conscious perception in Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism). […]

>The logical independence of Part (3) is becoming widely recognized with the measure problem of cosmology (Linde 1986; Garcia-Bellido 1994; Vilenkin 1995; Guth 2000; Tegmark 2005; Aguirre 2007; De Simone 2008; Linde & Noorbala 2010; Bousso 2010).
