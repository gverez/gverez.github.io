## On the interpretation of Bohmian mechanics <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Foreword [p. 231]

>>“Now the concept of "physical reality" presents itself as problematic and the question arises as to what, then, it really is and what theoretical physics (through quantum mechanics) tries to and to what its established laws refer. Certainly this question could be answered in different ways.” (Einstein 1953)

### Introduction [p. 231]
>Terms like “complementarity,” “potentia,” the “collapse” of the wave packet, “phenomena” identified with the whole experimental arrangement, and so forth, mark the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. Despite different public faces there is a core unifying theme. The theory is probabilistic and, in contrast with statistical mechanics, the standard interpretation regards the probabilities as objective, in the sense that it does not ground them in human limitations concerning knowledge of the finer details of things. The objectivity of the probabilities makes for indeterminism and, more fundamentally, for some sort of irrealism; since, according to the standard view, in significant situations there just are no finer details of things. The irreducibility of the probabilities might be thought to constitute a realism of a higher order (with respect to the probabilities themselves) except that in the standard interpretation the probabilities are entirely instrumental. They express a relation between a physical system and acts of measurement; they are probabilities for measurement outcomes. Thus, in a curious turn about, despite the objectivity of the probabilities the observer enters quantum theory in a fundamental way. On Bohr's view we are required to divide each experimental situation into an observer part, that is treated classically and to which we do not apply the quantum formalism, and a quantum part, to which we do. On Heisenberg's view the probabilities in the wave function somehow objectively represent both real “potentialities” and also subjective knowledge. Standing outside the causal order, an act of measurement “actualizes” a potentiality and, when we take account of this actualization, our changing knowledge is again objectively represented by a new “collapsed” wave function. Either view makes a mystery of how any object ever comes to possess any property; that is, of how anything at all actually happens. Standardly, we are cautioned not to inquire further. Physics stops here.
>
>There have always been dissenters from this quantum metaphysics. Some would re-interpret the formalism, others would amend it. Both de Broglie and Einstein were early amenders, each proposing a hidden variables extension of the quantum formalism and each subsequently retracting his effort. In Einstein's case the retraction was swift and permanent. With his field-theoretic orientation, a glimpse of quantum entanglement in his 1927 attempt to extend the quantum formalism convinced Einstein that a theory with quite different concepts would have to supersede quantum mechanics entirely and that fundamental physics would not advance by supplementing the existing quantum theory from within, in the manner of hidden variables (Fine 1986; Belousek 1996). Unlike de Broglie, after 1927 Einstein's interest in hidden variables was never born again, not even by David Bohm's re-introduction of them in 1952.
>
>Although Bohm's ideas failed to get Einstein's endorsement, they did interest John Bell whose indoctrination into quantum metaphysics was never complete. Bell's own investigations of nonlocality were sparked by the nonlocal character of the Bohm theory and when Bell came to believe that nonlocality was in the phenomena not just in our theories, Bohm's way appeared more palatable and interesting to him than it had before. I believe that the impetus for the current exploration of Bohm's program is due to Bell's taking it seriously. Whatever the sociological currents, clearly we have reached a stage where we can consider Bohmian mechanics on its own, and even distinguish it from Bohm's original ideas just as we distinguish Newton's mechanics from Newtonian mechanics.
>
>Let me recall some salient differences. The kinematics of Newton requires absolute space and time. Dynamically, Newton requires forces: external forces to account for change in the state of motion but also internal forces (vis insita and vis inertia) to account for resistance to change of state, and sometimes even maintenance of state. The whole edifice was intended to serve theological functions which constrain its interpretation (e.g., absolute space as God's sensorium, or the distinction between relative and absolute motion which is necessary to preserve the truth of Scripture). Supposedly, it is built to fixed methodological prescriptions (the famous rules of reasoning) intended to be exemplary for all of natural philosophy. Newtonian mechanics is a looser and more pragmatic framework used to treat bodies in motion by an analysis involving the fiction of point particles obeying Newton's laws. As above, Newton's mechanics is committed both to a specific kinematical ontology and a dynamical one; Newtonian mechanics in favor has no such commitments. One can dispense with absolute space of 3+1 “laboratory frames” that are near enough to inertial. One can treat motion in a flat neo-Newtonian 4-space, or absorb Newtonian gravitation in a curved 4-space. One can dispense with forces entirely in favor of energy, as the nineteenth century energetics movement insisted. One can take gravity as an action-at-a-distance force, or one can introduce a potential field and dispense with action-at-a-distance. One can use a minimal-action formulation that employs a teleological rather then a causal mode of explanation, and even make this serve theological or metaphysical ends – thinking of cosmic design or final causes. One can take formulations that highlight symmetry and conservation principles, and pursue the deeper significance of that. In short, there is a wide range of formulations and interpretations of Newtonian mechanics involving quite different answers to the question of what “really” exists, what concepts are “really” central, and what does it “really” mean (Jones 1991). If scientists or philosophers seek answers to such questions, it is clear that they will have to attach additional premises (from metaphysics or semantics or whatever) that go beyond the physics. Newtonian mechanics does not pick out a unique interpretation; it is not self interpreting.
>
>Thanks to David Bohm's decisive counterexample, we now know that quantum mechanics is not self-interpreting either, despite preachings and “proofs” to the contrary. In this essay I want to develop the theme that theories do not pick out a unique interpretation by treating Bohmian mechanics seriously and examining some of the interpretive latitude to be found there. This is as important a task for Bohmian mechanics as disentangling theological commitments was for the development of Newtonian mechanics. Certainly Bohm himself had an ideological commitment to a radically holistic world view that his physics was intended to serve.
>
>>“[T]he ambiguities which arise in the measurement process are only a special case Of a universal ambiguity in the very mode of existence of everything…. An essential aspect of what each thing is therefore lies in all other things, with which it is thus indivisibly related.” (Bohm 1961)
>
>Moreover, in the eyes of some, the way Bohmian mechanics undoes traditional quantum metaphysics is by substituting a different metaphysics of its own. By disentangling Bohmian mechanics from Bohm and exploring the latitude for different interpretations of Bohmian mechanics itself I hope to insure that Bohmian mechanics will continue to be a vehicle of genuine liberation from old quantum myths – rather than a source of new ones.



### Hidden variables [p. 233]

>Bohmian mechanics is a hidden variables theory, so it may be useful to say some things about hidden variables in general in order to see what is distinctive about the Bohmian version. The usual interpretation of the physical quantities, the “observables” of quantum mechanics, embodies a rule known as the “eigenvalue-eigenstate link” (Fine 1973): only in an eigenstate (or a proper mixture of eigenstates) does an observable have a value. In Bohr 's interpretation this principle regulates quantum discourse, functioning as a Rule of Silence: don't ask about – indeed don't even talk about – the values of observables in non-eigenstates. (By course graining, or introducing the notion of an approximate eigenvalue, we can adjust the rule for observables with a continuous part in their spectrum.) Much of the mystery of quantum mechanics is contained in these rules. In the first instance they make superposed states mysterious. What, for example, do we say about the spatial location of a system if experimentally we have narrowed its momentum to a nearly sharp value? It seems to be practically everywhere and also nowhere. Wise indeed, not to ask. The insolubility theorem for measurements shows that after a measurement interaction the pointer observable is similarly stricken (Fine 1970). This is the mystery of actualization referred to above, and hidden variables are supposed to be its solution.
>
>>“If one wishes to deal with this problem in a more adequate way it would seem almost inevitable that one will have somehow to introduce further physical conceptions and associated mathematical functions which could represent the state of the “physical” actuality as existing outside the mind of the observer who perceives it. These new “actuality functions” would supplement the wave function, which latter would then constitute only one side to the theory.” (Bohm 1961) […]
>
>When, according to the orthodox theory, the wave function colapses, a hidden-variables interpretation could allow the wave function to collapse as well, since on this interpretation the collapse does in fact represent an actual shift in our knowledge. The wave function guides the possible distribution of actual values but does not determine the values themselves. So when we learn something new, say by measurement, we must adjust the guiding wave accordingly. This picture is close to that of Heisenberg's but with “actuality” already there waiting to be revealed (not created) by an observation. Alternatively, we could adopt a no-collapse version drawing on the results of investigations into decoherence (e.g., Zeh 1993) to insure that the continuing branches of the wave function, only one of which contains an actual value, do not interfere and so may be effectively reduced. Whatever the choice, the evolution of the hidden states may give us wildly shifting values, constrained by the quantum probabilities but not by contiguity, or other such conditions. One could rationalize this by suggesting that below the level of the quantum probabilities there is no further simple lawfulness. In fact this was the rationale that Einstein sometimes suggested for why one might regard a merely probabilistic theory as fundamental, although Einstein could not bring himself to believe it. Or, one could try to do better and impose some lawfulness. The Bohm theory tries to do better, and it succeeds (replacing wild anarchy with true chaos) – but only by departing from the preceding random variables framework in significant ways.

### Dualism [p. 239]

>In the old quantum theory, wave-particle duality was the primary conceptual puzzle. The new quantum mechanics, despite its experimental success, did not advance our understanding of this. In Einstein's words it “hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One” (1926). Einstein and others were looking for a new conceptual framework that would synthesize both wave and particle concepts. In typical instrumentalist fashion, however, quantum mechanics avoided commitment to any such ontological enterprise. Instead, it claimed that its task was simply to predict and coordinate the results of experimental practice, where those results are interpreted in the old framework of classical physics. In addition, Bohr's doctrine of complementarity was designed as philosophical therapy to diagnose any lingering need that might be felt for radically new quantum concepts, and to cure it. Reversing the usual meaning of the word, in Bohr's hands, “complementarity” prescribed segregation not synthesis. Like those of the quantum theory, the fundamental concepts employed by Bohm also derive from classical point mechanics. However, where quantum mechanics merely flirts with dualism but avoids commitment, Bohmian mechanics embraces it. Bohmian mechanics requires both wave (function) and particle (position coordinates) in order to specify the state of a system. This development makes Einstein, writing in 1931, seem prescient, “In a particular department of physics the continuous field thus appeared side by side with the material point as the representative of physical reality. This dualism remains even today, disturbing as it must be to every orderly mind” (1954).
>
>Beyond the wave-particle duality, in Bohmian mechanics the wave function itself acquires a multiple personality. In one guise it behaves as what Einstein dubbed a Führungsfeld (guiding field), directing the particles along trajectories determined by solutions to the velocity equations. Paraphrasing Einstein, this is the role to which Born called attention in his second fundamental paper on collision processes (“the waves are present only to show the corpuscular light quanta the way” (1926; Ludwig 1968).) In satisfying Schrödinger's equation, however, the wave function also assumes the role of a true Gespensterfeld (spook field), acting as a “spook” or secret agent that reflects and transmits salient information about the environment, including measurement interactions. The “spooky” action-at-a-distance of ordinary quantum mechanics derives from this latter role. In Bohmian mechanics that nonlocality acquires the velocity field as an extra guide. Finally, as indicated above, has a third role to play; namely, that of a probability measure limiting the localization of particles. Echoing Bohr's style and approach, Bohm gave a philosophical rational for this limitation, connecting it with “unpredictable and uncontrollable disturbances introduced by the measurement apparatus” (1952). […]
>
>While in some sense Bohmian mechanics certainly requires both particle and wave is it really so clear that this is a dualism of a sort to disturb an orderly mind? For the wave is defined on configuration space and that means it is essentially dependent on all the possible particle positions. Measuring particle positions actually determines it. But the particles, as above, are informed and guided by the wave which makes their possible positions likewise dependent on the wave. The line of actual influence is one way, since the wave affects the actual motion of the particles, and not conversely. Still, this interdependence suggests that we might think more holistically not of two distinct kinds of entities, but of one new kind. If we think globally then we have a single entity everywhere at once whose nature makes “what each thing is” depend on “all other things, with which it is thus indivisibly related.” Thus it is a Bohmian X without separable parts. It changes over time but it does not move since, being everywhere at all times, it has no place to move to. Certainly this is a new synthetic conception and, despite its obvious tensions with relativistic spacetime, not something for which “dualism” seems an appropriate label.
>
>One version of this holistic conception might correspond to Bell's “Everett(?)” version of many words (Bohm without trajectories), hopefully without the radical solipsism that concerned Bell, “But if such a theory were taken seriously, it would hardly be possible to take anything else seriously.” (Bell 1987).
>
>Here, then, is nice interpretive latitude. We can think of Bohmian mechanics dualistically as involving the same old things, a one-way dualism of waves guiding particles, or a we can think of it monistically as involving a new kind of unitary world-stuff. Let us see if there is a similar latitude with respect to determinism and realism. Conventional wisdom has it that quantum mechanics is both irrealist and indeterministic. What does this mean and in what sense does Bohmian mechanics overcome it?

### Determinism [p. 240]

>Consider determinism first. Quantum mechanics is deterministic with respect to the evolution of the state function. Its indeterminism, if any, shows up only if we look at the values of the quantum observables. The problem here, however, is not that the initial values fail to determine the final values, or that they only do so stochastically. It is, rather, that we cannot specify the initial “state” of the system in the classical way, by giving a complete set of values for all the variables of state. In particular, there is no specification of simultaneous values for position and linear momentum. A standard formulation of determinism holds that for a closed system initial values for all the state variables determine final values. This formulation presupposes determinateness: it is possible to assign initial values to all the relevant variables at the same time. In the first instance, the failure of determinism in the quantum theory is the failure of determinateness. Bohmian mechanics overcomes the problem in the simplest possible way; namely, by placing primary emphasis on exactly one variable and letting the others trail in its footsteps. […]
>
>According to that view, identical experimental arrangements will generally produce different outcomes that, taken together, exhibit a definite probabilistic pattern. The indeterminism here consists in the fact that identical experimental arrangements produce different outcomes. (That these “undetermined” outcomes follow a probabilistic law is a nice bonus, showing, perhaps, that God is not malicious.) Here again Bohmian mechanics overcomes the difficulty by restricting attention to exactly one variable. As we saw above (Section 2), for a single variable any probability distribution can be looked at as the distribution function of a well defined random variable over some domain. We could think of the fair coin, for example, as having a set of “hidden states” (in fact, just its coordinates!) in half of which (for a typical toss) it would definitely land heads-up and in the other half definitely tails. Similarly for the spinning electron. Once the measurement problem for Bohmian mechanics is solved, and we have reduced all measurements to measurements of position, the clever argument of Section 3 shows how all the probabilities for measurement outcomes are just like deterministic account of the fair coin. […]
>
>Certainly that is the conventional view of Bohmian mechanics, but not the only one possible. To find another we might go back to a conception of determinism as a regulative principle, the venerable Laplacian idea that determinism is about seeking the possibility of accurate prediction. Recent philosophy typically scorns this conception (e.g., Earman 1986), which it regards as conflating ontology (the structure of the world) with epistemology (how we can know it). The philosophical generation closest to the new developments in physics, however, recognized that physics does not thrive on fine distinctions. They held that there was no conflation here, but rather good scientific judgment concerning the significance of determinism in theory development. They held that maintaining philosophical categories was not an end in itself, and that anyway the quest for an “ontology of the world” Often appeared more quixotic than sensible. In an essay for Die Naturwissenschaften in 1931, Moritz Schlick – the leader of the Vienna Circle and a student of Planck's – summed up the impact of quantum mechanics on causality (which he does not distinguish from determinism) this way.
>
>>“The principle of causality [“All events are in principle predictable.”]… constitutes an imperative to seek regularity, to describe events by laws…. And what quantum physics teaches us is just this: that the principle is bad, useless, impractical within the limits precisely laid down by the principle of indeterminacy.” (Schlick 1931)
>
>Rudolf Carnap drew much the same conclusion some thirty-five years later.
>
>>“Quantum theory is fundamentally indeterministic in that it does not supply definite predictions for the results of measurements…. Classical physicists were convinced that, with the progress of research, laws would become more and more exact, and that there is no limit to the precision that can be obtained in predicting observable events…. Determinism in this classical sense has been abandoned.” (Carnap 1966)
>
>The guiding idea here is to regard determinism (or causality) as standing or falling with the possibility of exact prediction. Determinism can be accepted to the extent to which practical prediction is possible, and rejected to the extent that quantum uncertainty, for example, places limits on predictability.
>
>If we follow the conception of determinism that regards predictability in principle as the central ingredient, then what is the verdict with respect to Bohmian mechanics? Is exact predictability there possible in principle or not? The answer depends critically on how one understands the limitation imposed on particle localization. If one regards this as an absolute uncertainty, as one must if the assertion of observational equivalence with quantum mechanics is true, then determinism is no different for Bohm than for Bohr. But even if we take the limitations as one for all practical purposes, then does determinism come out any better off for Bohm? The issue here is very much like the issue raised in nonlinear dynamics where, for systems sensitive to initial conditions, the evolution equations are formally deterministic, but useless for prediction. Shall we accept chaotic systems as deterministic or not? One could find some justification for going either way. The situation is similar in Bohmian mechanics (Dürr et al. 1992). One could say that Bohmian mechanics is deterministic in principle but that for all practical purposes we find the same limitations on predictability there as in quantum mechanics, and hence the same degree of indeterminism. Since determinism no longer functions to insure ever higher degrees of predictability, is this a distinction without a difference? (See related discussions in Cushing (1994) and in Kellert (1993).)
>
>There is a clear sense in which Bohmian mechanics and quantum mechanics are in the same boat with respect to determinism and a clear sense in which they differ. If one takes determinism to be about ontology and evolution equations, one could View Bohmian mechanics as a theory of a deterministic world that, ironically, we may only grasp as though it were indeterministic. Alternatively if determinism is epistemological and regulative, one could view Bohmian mechanics as utilizing the resources of deterministic evolution in a reductio; viz., to argue for the abandonment of determinism by showing that it is fruitless to seek after exact predictability. In trying to balance between ontology and epistemology, we are broaching questions of realism, our next topic.



### Realism [p. 243]

>One aspect of Bohr's complementarity is marked by his dictum that descriptions of the “phenomena” in quantum mechanics must always include the whole experimental arrangement. We have seen that this is precisely what Bohmian mechanics requires in order to get spreads of values compatible with the uncertainty formulas. More fundamentally the measured values of the dynamical variables depend on their being linked to position variables measurement interaction. The Schrödinger evolution of the wave function during the measurement establishes the linkage. Thus the wave function, acting as spook, scouts out the whole experimental arrangement. In Bohr's version this holistic conception of a “phenomenon” is tied to his rather mystical idea of the “feature of wholeness” or the irreducible “individuality” of the quantum phenomena. We saw in Section 4 that Bohm's writings show a similar mystical tendency that can be exploited to motivate a monistic interpretation of the theory as an account of a truly undivided universe. But none of this has to intrude into Bohmian mechanics, except in so far as we must calculate the effects of the experimental conditions in order to determine the experimental outcome.
>
>Although there is nothing necessarily mystical in Bohmian mechanics about the need to look at the whole experimental set-up, there is something of importance about it from an epistemological point of view. In standard quantum mechanics the “problem of observation” is often assimilated to the technical measurement problem. This is the problem of reconciling the linear dynamics with the registration of specific measurement outcomes by the measuring apparatus. Bohmian mechanics has no technical problem of this sort since the assumed determinateness makes existing values of position every-ready to record and be recorded. The observational problem, however, is actually much broader than this. A thoroughly classical model of an observation pictures the observing subject as an outside spectator viewing an objective reality, an onlooker who mirrors determinate aspects of the world that are of interest. The act of observation may, of course, make some difference to the observed system. But one can take that disturbance into account so as to eliminate observer effects or, at any rate, to discount for them. Thus in the classical picture what observation does is to reveal an observer-independent realm. Moreover, an important ingredient of this classical picture is the assumption that the observed-world is not very different from the unobserved world. How things are does not depend very much on whether things are observed. Observation is more passive than active. Reality is recorded not made. This picture of observation as disclosure is part of the “independence” that nature has from observation and it lies behind the idea that knowledge is objective. According to quantum mechanics, however, the observer does make a difference, indeed a difference so big that one cannot really discount the effect of observations so as to frame an observer-independent picture of the world. This is a standard epistemological route to quantum nonrealism. Although Bohmian mechanics looks more realist, insofar as it postulates an underlying reality, the role played by observation there is even more prominent than in standard quantum mechanics.
>
>Einstein first called our attention to this aspect of Bohmian mechanics (Einstein 1953). He considered a wave function for the one dimensional motion of a “particle” moving back and forth between two perfectly rigid and reflecting walls. Applied to a macro-particle we know that, to a good approximation, it has a definite position and a (non-zero) velocity at (almost) each moment. Quantum mechanics does not yield that conclusion, and indeed no quantum state function will yield simultaneous approximate positions and momenta that are stable in the classical way. What quantum mechanics does provide, via Born's rule, are correct predictions for P or for Q upon their respective measurement. Bohm's treatment of this example provides those same correct predictions, but also a picture of the situation before measurement. The picture it provides, however, is not the classical one of a particle moving to and fro. Since the phase of the wave function confined between the walls does not depend on the position coordinate of the particle its gradient vanishes. According to the Bohmian prescription for velocity, the unmeasured particle is actually standing still! Measurement disturbs the situation, freeing the wave function, which guides the particle into motion. Einstein thought the Bohmian picture sufficiently bizarre to reject this prescription for introducing determinate P and Q.
>
>>“From a purely logical standpoint there is, in my opinion, no principled objection to be made against Bohm's completion of the quantum theory. Looked at from a physical standpoint, however, Bohm's way out does not seem to me acceptable. In all cases where the wave function is not approximated in the neighborhood of each point by a travelling wave, one obtains values for the momenta that violate the requirement that the quantum theory should go over to classical mechanics in the limit. It is connected with this, that the Bohmian rule determines the momentum values not through a Fourier transform but rather through a local regularity in coordinate space.” (Letter to Aron Kupperman, 1953)
>
>Bohm countered that this theory did not contradict any known experimental facts and he declared that only contradiction by experiment could be sufficient grounds for rejecting a consistent theory. Moreover Bohm urged that it was not reasonable to require exact correspondence with classical predictions in a domain where those predictions cannot be experimentally verified. (Bohm 1953)
>
>Ironically, Bohm's response to Einstein's criticism employs the same positivist lines of defense that Bohr and others had used to turn back criticism of standard quantum mechanics, and to marginalize deviant “interpretations” - including Bohm's! Characteristically, Einstein paid no more attention to Bohm's methodological refrain than he had to the same tune when broadcast from Copenhagen. Note the difference, however, between Bohm and Copenhagen. On the latter view a rule of silence takes over and we should not frame any hypotheses about the state of motion of the unobserved “bouncing” ball. According to Bohm we need not be silent since there is a determinate reality, regardless of observation. That reality, however, is significantly different when observed than when unobserved. Moreover, observation does not reveal the unobserved situation, whose status is that of a theoretical postulate. For the pre-measurement state is highly unstable and observation necessarily triggers velocity effects that cannot be discounted without knowing the exact position of the unmeasured particle. That knowledge, however, is bounded. Thus, in order to overcome the quantum rule of silence, Bohmian mechanics pays a price. It departs from the classical picture of observation as disclosure, thereby modifying the conceptions of observer-independence and objectivity which that picture supports. It is important to understand this as clearly as we can in order to understand how the “realism” of Bohmian mechanics compares with the irrealism of quantum mechanics.
>
>Classical scientific realism is a blend of metaphysics and epistemology. It makes two claims: metaphysically, that there is an observer independent world; epistemologically, that in our theories and observations we gain access to that very world. To paraphrase Kant: reality without disclosure is blind; disclosure without reality is empty. Metaphysically, with respect to certain quantities Bohmian mechanics is realist; certainly with respect to position, but also with respect to momentum and the classical dynamical variables that can be defined from these two. Moreover, observations of position really disclose position. As we have seen, this is not the case for momentum. Rather, as in Einstein's non-bouncing ball, typically momentum is created by the act of measurement, and pre-existing momentum values (while “real”) are not disclosed by the act of momentum measurement. Thus for momentum (and any similarly defined variables), “The value of the measurement only arises in the act of measurement itself in accord with the unique probability given it by the function” (Einstein 1949). This is the position of the physicist called “B” (no doubt “B” was for Bohr but here too for Bohm) in Einstein's “Autobiographical Notes”. Nonlocality is supposed to drive B to admit that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Leaving aside Einstein's concerns with nonlocality and incompleteness, his characterization brings out exactly what is peculiar about Bohmian realism. From a realist we do not expect measured values to arise “in the act of measurement itself”. That is, beyond the existence of pre-measurement values (determinateness), we expect that those are the values disclosed by measurement. As Einstein's “A” physicist puts it, “The individual system (has before measurement) a definite value…, and more specifically that value which is determined by a measurement of this variable” (1949). Thus what Einstein demands is that realism blend metaphysics with epistemology, as above. This is a demand for the right sort of concepts. They must be both determinate and accessible. In Bohmian mechanics only “position” is like that. That is to say that with respect to all the other variables Bohmian mechanics is not realist in the expected sense.
>
>There is a familiar way of defusing this departure from realism; namely, to label it contextualism and to assert that it is required by the no-go theorems and therefore by the very structure of quantum mechanics itself. One difficulty with this move is that we do not know exactly what contextualism is. Like Bohr 's “complementarity” it is a balm in search of an itch. For some, contextualism is a formal feature: one operator can represent many physical quantities. For others, it marks the fact that specification of a value for a variable is always relative to a context. In this latter sense probably every physical variable (and certainly every dispositional property) is contextual. I believe that contextualism first arose in Bell's development of Gleason's theorem into a Kochen-Specker type no-go result (Bell 1966). There Bell identified an assumption of the proofs, which was that the measured values of variables were functions only of the hidden parameters and of the quantum state. One way of contravening this, and so possibly of avoiding the no-go results, was to make those values also depend on what variables (if any) were co-measured. Subsequently, this sort of co-measurement contextualism came to be seen as a cost of doing hidden variable business, as though quantum mechanics plus hidden variables somehow implies contextualism. If so, the criticism raised by Einstein above, and the desire for a classically realist version of quantum mechanics would be in vain. But, of course, one can get around the no-go theorems in other ways. For example, we can simply deny the functional connections (e.g., the sum and product rules) which those proofs posit (Fine 1973; 1974), and we can allow variables to have values outside their spectrum. In Bohmian mechanics pre-measurement values are not confined to the spectrum, but also in Bohmian mechanics measured values depend sensitively on what variables (if any) are co-measured (Bell 1987). So Bohmian mechanics gets around the Kochen-Specker type no-go theorems both by allowing values other than eigenvalues and by exhibiting co-measurement contextualism for the dynamical variables other than position.
>
>Co-measurement contextualism is one way in which measured values can arise in the act of measurement. If the result of measuring A depends critically on the co-measurement of a some B that is spatially separate from A (in particular if the separation of the measurement events is space- like), then this sort of contextualism amounts to nonlocality, which is how Bohmian mechanics gets around the Bell type theorems. These resources, by virtue of which Bohmian mechanics by-passes the Kochen-Specker and the Bell type no-go theorems, do not by themselves entail a conflict with realism. In particular, if the only determine variable were position, and all the other dynamical variables were treated as pure dispositions (recall the discussion in Section 3), then there would be no problem in Bohmian mechanics over the disclosure of pre-measurement values. That problem is generated by the particular Bohmian mixture of determinateness and co-measurement contextualism.
>
>The culprit here is the guidance condition that associates velocities with the wave function. That condition insures that the classical dynamical variables have pre-measurement values outside their spectrum and therefore values that could not possibly be disclosed by measurement (at least if observational equivalence with quantum mechanics is to be maintained). Moreover, by making the velocities a function of the wave function in coordinate representation, initial data on particle positions is required in order to fix the velocities. Unlike dispositions, the velocities are already there in pre-measurement situations, but hidden. The question naturally arises as to whether they are (or ought to be considered) “real”, in the usual sense. If reality without disclosure is truly blind, perhaps it would be better to treat Bohmian velocity, as what Vaihinger (1925) called a “scientific fiction”; that is, an expedient means to certain ends; namely, a means for calculating particle trajectories and positions. Born's original picture comes to mind here.
>
>>“[T]he guiding field, represented by a scalar function of the coordinates of all the particles involved and the time, propagates in accordance with Schrödinger’s differential equation. Momentum and energy, however, are transferred *as if* the corpuscles… actually moved.” (Born 1926; Ludwig 1968. Emphasis mine.)
>
>Taking Born's “as if” seriously would interpret the dynamical variables as calculational tools. The measured values of these fictional variables in a spatio-temporal region would depend on the particle positions observed there and on co-measurements, some distant. So the variables would be subject both to co-measurement contextualism and to nonlocality. For fictions, however, neither feature seems worrisome. Unmeasured values would be treated as conceptual devices for calculating the results of future measurements of position and not as the possession of some property, not even a “relational” property.

>The fictionalist interpretation suggested above, and by Born's seminal remarks on the significance of the wave function, differs from approaches to Bohmian mechanics that regard the dynamical variables as what one might call quasi-real (e.g., Holland, 1993). Here the dynamical variables are assigned pre-measurement values signifying some intrinsic-looking property of the system. But the assigned values are not the ones disclosed by measurement. Once one appreciates that classical observer-independence and objectivity are weakened in a quasi-real interpretation it seems fair enough to highlight the best candidates for what may be really real, and to fictionalize the rest. This difference over whether to treat the dynamical observables other than position as quasi-real or as fictions marks a nice interpretive fork for Bohmian mechanics. The question that now emerges from our attempt to understand realism with respect to Bohmian mechanics is just this: how shall we regard position and the particle trajectories?

>So far I have been emphasizing a specific two-part criterion of reality; namely, (observer-independence) if something is real then it exists whether or not it is observed and (accessibility) measurement reveals it's pre-existing situation. I urge this not as a sufficient but as a necessary condition for judging that something is real. Is there something else to require, in addition to this criterion, which would be sufficient and do we find that something else in Bohmian mechanics? I do not think that there are universal, subject neutral requirements. Historically, issues over what is real tend to fade away rather than to be settled by principled demonstrations. On pragmatic grounds on comes to accept something, and the question as to its reality goes away when it works well and fruitfully over time in a variety of experimental and theoretical contexts in which it seems to play an essential role. For that to happen the concept must mesh appropriately with others whose reality-status is not in question. A problem with the position variable and the trajectories in Bohmian mechanics is that they do not have anything else “real” with which to mesh, except the wave function itself. Since the wave function is only defined by reference to position coordinates, this generates an uncomfortably small circularity. Moreover, trajectories conjure up the picture of moving particles. But the reality-status of the ordinary dynamical concepts associated with that picture, the momentum along the path or the energy carried from point to point, as we have seen, is open to question and can not be used to ground the reality of the particle positions. The reverse is true. The velocity field, it seems, is there just so that we may interpolate the particle trajectories. Moreover, for experimental purposes, that is for obtaining experimental predictions, there is little value in actually integrating the velocity equations to obtain the exact trajectories. […] Thus it seems reasonable to ask how seriously the particle trajectories themselves ought to be taken. Do the particles really move, or do the calculated trajectories function as intervening variables that could be eliminated? As Born seems to suggest, do the trajectories too fall under Vaihinger's as if?

>We know the answer. Certainly the particle trajectories are eliminable, for that is how one gets ordinary quantum mechanics! Cushing tells a wonderful and illuminating tale of how the Bohm theory, rather than quantum mechanics, might have won the allegiance of the scientific community and how physics in this century might have developed on that basis (Cushing 1994). Given the entanglement of physics with positivistic philosophy in the first half of this century, a process initiated by Einstein and relativity, we might embellish Cushing's counterfactual history a bit. We might conjecture that if Bohmian mechanics had indeed been the first theory of the quantum domain, subsequent epistemological discussions might well have inspired at least some participants to wield Occam's Razor (along lines suggested above) to pare away everything that is not simply quantum mechanics! Well, perhaps not quite everything. For, although the continuous trajectories provided by the velocity field might be eliminated as “real”, if the association of position coordinates with the wave function also goes we are left with the problem of actuality. Surely one would be reluctant to move to a theory in which it is a mystery that anything happens at all, especially if there is an alternative. What emerges then is a random variables representation of the position variable involving particles that are as if they move according to the velocity field. (See Section 3.) On this interpretation what is real is the wave function and that there are determinate particle positions, and nothing else. For the particular trajectories are a convenience. What we actually need is that in a super-position in coordinate representation the particles are spread across some of the branches. Spatial separation of the branches will then suffice to define an effective part of the wave function with which to work. At the heart of Bohmian mechanics is the wave function and determinate particle positions, and perhaps we need be realist about nothing else.

>In this interpretation the wave function does not actually guide the moving particles. It just assigns particle positions and shifting distributions. Thus one might regard as a kind of global hidden hand with just these functions. One version of this might be the monistic picture in Section 4. Maybe reality consists of a unitary global X that organizes particle aspects everywhere and at every moment in accord with a changing wave aspect. Of course one might go the other way and treat the wave function simply as a tool for how we are to take account of the environment in setting up a model of an experimental situation. This is an instrumental alternative not likely to be attractive to those whose interest in Bohmian mechanics is realist-driven. It is a genuine alternative nevertheless, and may well correspond with Born's original picture of the wave function.

### Concluding remarks [p. 250]

>In Newtonian mechanics we are comfortable with a wide range of interpretive options. My hope was to display some similar options for Bohmian mechanics. In Section 4 we saw that Bohmian mechanics is a dualistic theory (wave + particle) that could also be monistic (an undivided X). In Section 5 we saw that the evolution equations of Bohmian mechanics certainly make it deterministic, except in so far as determinism really has to do with predictability, in which case it is indeterministic. In Section 6 we looked at how momentum and perhaps other dynamical variables of “realist” Bohmian mechanics depart from the realist ideal of an accessible, observer independent realm. That marks these variables at best as quasi-real or, more radically, as fictional. The particle motions, the Bohmian trajectories in configuration space, are subject to similar interpretations. This leaves the wave function, which could be read as a holistic Bohmian hidden hand, or as an instrumental Bornian probability guide. Moreover Bohmian mechanics can be done with quantum potentials and forces, or (as here) without. There certainly seem to be choices sufficient for different philosophical creeds and ideologies. More importantly, we know from the Newtonian case that interpretive latitude contributes to heuristic power. Thus Bohmian mechanics emerges as a real theory with good prospects.
