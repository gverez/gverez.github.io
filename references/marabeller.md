## Bohm and the “inevitability” of acausality <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Introduction [p. 211]

>Referring to the orthodox denial of the possibility of quantum ontology, John Bell invoked a vivid image: “It is,” he wrote, “as if our friends could not find words to tell us about the very strange places where they went on holiday. We could see for ourselves whether they came back browner or fatter” (Bell 1987).
>
>Why were quantum physicists mute for so long on the issues of quantum reality? Why did they voluntarily give up an exciting, though admittedly inconclusive, quest to unveil the mystery of the quantum world? Why did they hold fast to the notion of the lack of objectivity and inevitable acausality, despite the existence of Bohm's alternative version?
>
>David Bohm himself explained this seemingly puzzling situation by the inability of the orthodox physicists to conceive of any other concepts, except classical (waves and particles) and by their commitment to the philosophy of positivism:
>
>>“… There appears to have existed, especially among physicists such as Heisenberg, and others, who first discovered the quantum theory, a rather widespread impression that the human brain is, broadly speaking, able to conceive of only two kinds of things, namely fields and particles". (Bohm 1957)
>
>Another reason for the refusal to consider a “subquantum-mechanical level,” according to Bohm, has been the adoption of the positivistic thesis of elimination of unobservables from physical theorizing, “a general philosophical point of view containing various branches such as ‘positivism,’ ‘operationalism,’ ‘empiricism,’ and others, which began to attain a widespread popularity among physicists during the twentieth century” (Bohm 1957).
>
>I will reiterate Bohm's insight about the intimate connection between the finality of acausality, indispensability of classical concepts, and positivism, but will provide a different account of their interrelatedness, along more sociological lines. I will also analyze Bohm's own views on the relation between classical and quantum concepts, and I will argue that even before Bohm's conversion took place, an unbridgeable difference of opinion existed between Bohm and Bohr.
>
>From a certain perspective, the stand of the foundational acausality of quantum theory can be a natural and a legitimate one. If our best scientific theory is de facto acausal, what good reasons, except of an unwarranted a priori belief in classical causality, would urge physicists to search for a causal version? After all, many physicists, including the late Bohm himself, did not find determinism either indispensable or appealing. Heisenberg's argument – that, if physicists are convinced in the correctness of the quantum theory, which is built on probabilistic foundations, then the conclusion of lack of causality follows (Heisenberg 1958) – is a characteristic example of a sound reasoning which Arthur Fine (1986) coined by the term “entheorizing.” The metaphysical question of whether a certain property is a property of our world is translated into the question of fruitfulness, or correctness, of a theory, which entails this property.
>
>Yet such sober “entheorizing” reasoning is rare. The Copenhagen writings, Heisenberg included, are permeated by the heavy rhetoric of finality, of inevitability of acausality, of impossibility of a causal alternative. It is this argumentation of inevitability which calls for an explanation.
>
>It is helpful to divide the historical issue of acausality in quantum mechanics into a few distinct, though interrelated issues: how and why did probabilistic arguments become foundational in quantum mechanics? How and why were strong anticausal sentiments introduced and advocated? How did the claims of inevitability evolve and by what means were they argued? And why were they seemingly so effective and persuasive? Though briefly attempting to deal with all these issues, it is the anatomy of inevitability which constitutes the main theme of this paper.

### Acausality and matrix mechanics [p. 212]

>I have treated the first issue, the question of how the probabilistic arguments became central in quantum mechanics, elsewhere, so I will mention here only some relevant highlights.
>
>The first general, confident and unequivocal stand against causality occurred in Heisenberg's uncertainty paper (1927). In this paper Heisenberg, countering Schrödinger's accusation of unintuitiveness of matrix mechanics, restored the regular space-time and resurrected the visualization of particles in spatio-temporal statistical terms. In the original matrix theory, the meaning of the matrix elements was a solely electromagnetic one, connected with frequencies, intensities, and polarizations of the emitted atomic radiation (Beller 1983). The original matrix theory was a discrete deterministic one: the problem was fully determined when the Hamiltonian of the system was known. Nobody hurried to draw any categorical indeterministic conclusions from the fact that matrix elements represented transition probabilities. Many theorists, including Born and Jordan, did not exclude the possibility that this might be a temporary weakness of the theory – a stand remarkably close to Einstein's. In November 1925 Pauli declared in a letter to Bohr that a satisfactory physical theory should contain no probability concepts in its fundamental propositions. As late as the beginning of 1927, just before the uncertainty paper, Jordan argued that as long as quantum theory is not reduced to a theory of elementary independent probabilities, there can be no verdict on the issue of determinism (Beller 1985; 1990). No wonder Max Born did not feel at first that his statistical interpretation of the wave function had any far-reaching philosophical implications (Beller 1990). Nor did the quantum physicists, Heisenberg included, initially express any belief in an a priori status of discontinuities, or of a quantum postulate, in Bohr's terms: in fact, Heisenberg initially rejoiced that the matrix theory does not postulate dogmatically the discrete energy levels – their existence follows from the mathematical formalism. Heisenberg, Jordan and Born described this as a "notable advantage" of the new matrix mechanics as compared to the old quantum theory (Beller 1985).
>
>The stand against causality, especially in Heisenberg's able hands, crystallized as a response to the threat of Schrödinger's competitive theory. Schrödinger's declared aspirations were to eliminate the “monstrous” – as he called them – quantum jumps, replacing the Göttingen-Copenhagen research program with a continuous causal alternative. It was in response and in opposition to Schrödinger's threat that Heisenberg resurrected the foundational status of discontinuity, and swiftly developed arguments against causality. It is around the status of “quantum jumps,” which Schrödinger aimed to eliminate, that the controversy and the shaping of the Copenhagen philosophy took place – the indeterminism and the wave-particle duality were, to a large extent, derivative issues (Beller 1992).
>
>The probabilistic formalism of quantum mechanics was developed by Dirac and Jordan, as a direct extension of Heisenberg's fluctuation paper (1927), in which, against Schrödinger and his supporters, Heisenberg claimed that for two atoms in resonance, the exchange of energy must occur via discrete jumps. One cannot obtain the energy of an atom as a function of time, argued Heisenberg, but only the time mean of energy, or probability of energy to have a particular value. Similarly, for any dynamical variable, both Dirac and Jordan postulated, one can only calculate the probability that it lies between two specified values. In this way, the discontinuity and acausality were entrenched into the very axiomatic basis of quantum mechanics to a degree that made them appear as “hard facts” of nature (Beller 1992).
>
>This reading dispels two widespread misconceptions concerning the history of quantum mechanics. The first misconception assumes that an abstract quantum formalism developed prior to any interpretive concerns, simply as a disinterested mathematical activity. According to the second misconception, the Copenhagen-Göttingen interpretation came first, and only later Schrödinger's competing interpretive attempts followed. Both claims, I believe, must be substantially qualified. From the beginning, the orthodox interpretation and the formalism itself developed as a defense project of the past achievements that Schrödinger threatened to undermine, and as a philosophical legitimization of the Copenhagen-Göttingen research program against any challenge, or alternative. The ambitious Heisenberg, who laid the foundations of matrix mechanics, was one of the central players in this enterprise. Strong sentiments against causality quickly arose precisely because causality became intrinsically tied up with a threat of opposition.
>
>Perhaps another few words about why it was Heisenberg who initially led the campaign against causality are in place here. The interpretive attempts of quantum theorists took place against the background of philosophical controversies around the change of status of space and time concepts implied by Einstein's relativity. Young Heisenberg witnessed the emotional, and politically charged, confrontation between Einstein and the Neo-Kantians (Cassidy 1992). The question whether the same fate did not await the a priori status of causality, as happened with the a priori status of Newtonian-Euclidean space and time, was a natural one. An intensely ambitious individual, who aspired, following Einstein's example, to leave his mark on the philosophy of Nature and the public imagination, and not only to solve scientific “puzzles,” must have kept an eye on this issue. No less than Heisenberg's own teacher, Arnold Sommerfeld, posed the high-stakes challenge. Discussing “the present state of physics” and referring to the causality issue just a few months before Heisenberg's uncertainty paper, Sommerfeld called for a “new Kant” (Sommerfeld 1927). Heisenberg wanted to be the new Kant – in his initial presentations of the uncertainty principle for academic audiences, he always described the abandonment of the “Kantian category of causality” as a natural continuation of the Einsteinian overthrow of Kantian space and time as forms of intuitions (e.g., Heisenberg 1928; 1931).
>
>How opportune for Heisenberg that the ambition to be the new Kant and the aim to conclusively counter the opposition so neatly coincided!


### Acausality and the “indispensability” of classical concepts [p. 214]

>The philosophical framework of the orthodox interpretation arose initially as a forced response to the challenges of opposition and developed subsequently into the huge project of legitimization of the Göttingen-Copenhagen program. As the argumentation for “finality,” or inevitability, is perhaps the strongest way to advance any sort of claim, the rhetoric of finality and inevitability permeates many philosophical arguments in the Copenhagen framework. Both Bohr and Heisenberg present a search for a causal quantum theory not merely as hopeless, but as downright meaningless. Heisenberg argues (1934) that “there seems to be the strongest evidence” for the “final” renunciation of causality and objectivity. The concept of “causality” after the discovery of quantum mechanics became as devoid of meaning as the concept of the “end of the world” after the discoveries of Columbus and Magellan (Heisenberg 1934). Bohr, claiming that acausality is “unavoidable,” ridiculed the “odd wish” for causal description (Bohr 1937): “It appears to me to be exactly that, that we would say that we are not satisfied with descriptions in English, and we might like, because we can't get the word ‘causality’…. to translate it into Sanskrit, to get everything different…” And Heisenberg, quoting Bohr, asserts that the structure of Bohm's “strange” arguments for hidden variables is identical to the hope that “2 x 2 = 5, for this would be of great advantage for our finances” (1958).
>
>One would expect that the proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation are in possession of some very strong arguments, if not of inevitability, at least of high plausibility. Yet a critical reading reveals that all the far-reaching, or one might say far-fetched, claims of inevitability are built on shaky circular arguments, on intuitively appealing, but incorrect, statements, on metaphorical allusions to quantum “inseparability” and “indivisibility,” which have nothing to do with quantum entanglement and non-locality. Acausality, in the writings of Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli and Born, is not a sharply defined concept. Precisely because acausality is used as a tool of legitimization, as a sword to pin down the opponents, its meaning changes from text to text, from context to context.
>
>Despite Bohr's life-long preoccupation with causality, his use of this concept is unsystematic and sometimes contradictory. Bohr had a very “thick” notion of causality: sometimes it is a cause-effect relationship, sometimes it is “determinism,” sometimes it is an epistemological –other times ontological – definition, sometimes causality is equated only with applicability of conservation laws of energy and momenta, other times with simultaneous applicability of both space-time and energy-momenta concepts. Sometimes Bohr's understanding of causality is a probabilistic one, applying to an individual system, and sometimes, it is a statistical ensemble interpretation. Bohr often conflates determinism and predictability, which are substantially different notions. I will follow in this paper Bohr's, Heisenberg's and Bohm's use of “determinism” and “causality” as interchangeable notions, despite the differences between them. These differences are not important for the issues discussed here.
>
>Among Heisenberg's many argument for the finality of acausality, one of the more frequent and careless ones is the argument of the mobility of the “cut” between the quantum object and classical measuring device. Heisenberg argues that the statistical aspect enters only on the dividing line, or on “the cut,” (Heisenberg 1979; 1958), because on both sides of the line there is a deterministic lawfulness (on one side, because of the laws of classical physics, and on the other side, because of the differential equations of quantum mechanics). If we supplement the variables at the dividing line by some “hidden variables” and then “move” the “cut” to a new place, we will come into conflict with the causal laws that prevailed at this place to begin with (the situation becomes overdetermined).
>
>This argument is, of course, unconvincing. If we move the cut into what was the classical domain, it does not necessary imply that the situation becomes overdetermined – the “hidden” variables for the cut can be the existing variables in macrodomain, such as Bohm's supplement of the quantum description by the position variable. It is not too hard to find serious flaws in other arguments advanced by Heisenberg along similar lines. The more interesting question is: when, for what purposes, and in what contexts did Heisenberg use such arguments?
>
>The crucial part of all the “cut” arguments is the necessity of describing the measuring apparatus by classical concepts, which is connected with a more far-reaching Bohrian claim of the denial of "quantum concepts" and "quantum ontology." In many of his writings Heisenberg distances himself from this position. Thus, he often says that the measuring apparatus “can” (as opposed to the Bohrian “has to”) be described by classical concepts. Nor does he agree with Bohr that no new concepts and no new language beyond classical can be conceived – in fact, while discussing the lessons of the theory of relativity, he emphasizes that new concepts arise and a new language develops “which adjusts itself after some time to the new situation” (1958). For example, in “the theory of general relativity, the language by which we describe the general laws actually now follows the scientific language of the mathematicians” (1958).
>
>I have argued elsewhere that mathematical physicists, especially those who had a first-hand familiarity with the relativity theory, such as Born, Fock and Heisenberg, did not accept the Bohrian special status of the classical concepts (Beller 1996). Instead, they held that justification of concepts arises from their place in the coherent mathematical formalism of the physical domain – be it classical or quantum. There is no warrant, therefore, for giving a special status to classical notions. David Bohm was of a similar opinion: “Mathematics in general and the differential calculus in particular have played a key role in guiding the development of a clear concept of accelerating motion… it is practically impossible to gain such a clear concept on the basis of everyday experience alone, or even on the basis of the laboratory experience alone” (1957). Similarly, our concepts of waves come not from watching water waves, but from the mathematical treatment of interference and wave propagation (1957). Bohr, a “natural philosopher, and not a mathematical physicist” (Heisenberg's expression) was, I believe, quite unique among quantum physicists in his denial of the possibility of the new concepts. One cannot then avoid the question: why and when did Heisenberg support this peculiar, unnatural for a mathematical physicist, doctrine of Bohr?
>
>In the cut argument, analyzed above, Heisenberg emphasizes the mobility of the cut as “particularly important.” The next sentence reveals why it is so important: “an appreciation of this fact also helps to dispose of an objection frequently made against the finality [italics mine] of quantum mechanics” (1934). Heisenberg immediately proceeds to the “more general question of the finality” of changes promoted by the Copenhagen proponents, and concludes that the renunciation of objectivity and causality will be final (1934).
>
>Similarly, Heisenberg presented the flawed cut argument in another lecture a year later, again using it as an argument for “the finality of the statistical character of quantum mechanics,” and against “any hope” of “completing quantum mechanics on a determinist [sic] basis” (1936). Again, in another article, Heisenberg claimed that the “root of the statistical character of quantum theory” is the “tension” between the necessity to use the concepts of the classical physics and “from the knowledge that these concepts do not fit accurately.” Heisenberg mentions that “it has been suggested that one should depart from classical concepts,” searching for radically new ones that “might possibly lead back to a nonstatistical, completely objective description of nature” (Heisenberg 1958). He immediately denies such a possibility, repeating the Bohrian argument that “the concepts of classical physics are just a refinement of the concepts of daily life” (1958). Heisenberg's denial is a forceful one: “We cannot and should not replace these [classical] concepts by any others… we can not and should not try to improve them” (1958).
>
>I have argued elsewhere (Beller 1996) that the Copenhagen interpretation cannot be reconstructed as a coherent philosophical framework, for it is more adequately described as a collection of local, often contradictory, arguments in changing theoretical and socio-political circumstances. Heisenberg's contradictory statements about the necessity of classical concepts in different contexts is another example for my claim. From our discussion it becomes clear that Heisenberg insists on the indispensability of classical concepts in those contexts, and, as far as I am able to determine, only in those contexts, when he attempts to argue the finality of the indeterministic Copenhagen version.
>
>Returning to Bohm's claim that it is Heisenberg's belief in the indispensability of classical concepts (and Heisenberg's inability to conceive of other categories than waves and particles) which lead him to belief in finality, my claim is rather the opposite one. It is the stand of, or vested interest in, finality that led Heisenberg to insist on the indispensability of classical concepts in a local and opportunistic fashion. There was neither belief nor commitment on Heisenberg's part – only a selective and opportunistic use of Bohrian doctrine in the circumstances when Heisenberg's aim was to argue against the opposition and for the finality of the Copenhagen orthodoxy. This is a characteristic example of powerful social strategy of legitimization, disguised as an abstract theoretical argument.
>
>It is quite instructive to see how Heisenberg argues in those articles in which he discusses the lessons both of relativity theory and of quantum physics. For the main lesson of relativity, as Heisenberg presents it, is the denial of the Kantian a priori status of classical concepts, while the defense of the Copenhagen interpretation forces him to claim their indispensability and finality in an a prioristic Kantian sense. Ingenious Heisenberg has no problem avoiding the impasse: he invents the notions of “practical a priori,” and “relative synthetic a priori,” which are, in fact, contradictions in terms. The only function of these self-contradictory notions, as they appear in Heisenberg's works, is to argue for an a priori status of classical concepts in the context of the defense of the Copenhagen framework, against Heisenberg's own better judgment when discussing relativity (1958).
>
>David Bohm, after his “conversion” had taken place, understood that arguments of inevitability of acausality cannot be compelling. They are, in fact, circular arguments: “the conclusion that there is no deeper level of causally determined motion is just a piece of circular reasoning, since it will follow only if we assume beforehand that no such level exists” (Bohm 1957).


### Operationalism: from consistency to “inevitability” arguments [p. 218]

>Bohr's arguments of the “inevitability” of acausality and complementarity similarly cannot withstand close scrutiny. I have argued elsewhere that, in the best case, Bohr's arguments of inevitability are disguised arguments of consistency (Beller 1993). “The uncontrollable disturbance,” or uncontrollable interaction between the measuring and the measured, is the crucial component of all these arguments, and the basic building block on which Bohr's web of arguments for complementarity rests. Bohr employed different strategies for making this “uncontrollable interaction,” founded on the “indivisibility of the quantum of action,” a fundamental concept in quantum philosophy.
>
>Yet how exactly does the “uncontrollability of the interaction” follow from the "”indivisibility of the quantum of action,” and what do these terms mean? Their use and their interconnection vary, in fact, significantly, before and after 1935 (the EPR challenge.) Before 1935, Bohr's arguments are incorrect, and are based on the discredited later idea of disturbance. After 1935, the arguments are tautological, or circular: textual analysis reveals a web of terms, where “indivisibility of the quantum of action,” “individuality of quantum phenomena,” “unsurveyability of interaction,” or “uncontrollability of interaction” have the same meaning, and are interchangeable.
>
>The following lines are typical in Bohr's pre-1935 writings: “Quantum of action means that it is not possible to distinguish between the phenomena and observation… we cannot make the interaction between the measuring instrument and the object as small as we like. Now, that means that phenomena are influenced by observation.” (Bohr 1930) Both talks about the “difficulty of distinguishing between the object and measuring instrument... when it is necessary to take the atomic constitution of measuring instruments into account.” (Bohr 1931)
>
>Before 1935 3indivisibility of the quantum of action” simply meant “finitude” of the quantum of action. Measurement “disturbs” the phenomena precisely because of the atomic constitution of measuring devices. The underlying intuition was that, because in the quantum domain phenomena and measuring interaction are “of the same order of magnitude,” such finite interactions, contrary to the classical case, cannot be neglected or accounted for. Such intuitively appealing argumentation was, of course, incorrect. The concept of disturbance is an inconsistent one: it presupposes the existence of objective exact values that are changed by measurement, contrary to the desired conclusion of their indeterminateness. Moreover, the finitude of interaction does not assure uncontrollability – many classical measurements involve finite interactions that cannot be neglected, yet can be calculated.
>
>After 1935, when the EPR challenge undermined the notion of disturbance (Fine 1986; Beller and Fine 1994), Bohr's reasoning undergoes an about-face. The “uncontrollability of the interaction” is now inherently tied to the necessity of describing measuring devices by classical terms only, neglecting “in principle” their atomic constitution:
>
>>“The essentially new feature is a fundamental distinction between atomic objects and measuring devices… it is this fundamental distinction that excludes any separate account of interaction just because in the description of the measuring apparatus we have to entirely look apart from the quantum.” (Bohr 1958)
>
>In Bohr's later writings the “uncontrollability” of the interaction follows from its “unsurveyability,” which in turn follows from the dogmatically postulated principal difference between the quantum object and the classical measuring apparatus. If, in pre-1935 Bohr, the uncontrollability necessitated acausality, in the later writings it is the statistical character of quantum theory that leads to inseparability of the measuring and the measured, and to the “uncontrollability” and “unsurveyability” of the measuring interaction.
>
>This reversal of what is to be explained and what is foundational, of explanans and explanandum, is frequent in Bohr's and Heisenberg's writings. This reversal is an eloquent illustration of the circularity and ad hocness of many of their arguments. One striking example is Heisenberg's reversal of the idea of disturbance – if the original idea of disturbance was based on indivisibility, or finitude, of microscopic particles, now the “unavoidable disturbance” is seen as the reason for their indivisibility:
>
>>“Nature thus escapes accurate determination… by an unavoidable disturbance which is part of every observation… In atomic physics it is impossible to neglect the changes produced on the observed object by observation ... The supposition that electrons, protons and neutrons, according to modern physics the basic properties of matter, are really the final, indivisible particles of matter, is only justified by this fact.” (Heisenberg 1979)
>
>Heisenberg's and Bohr's arguments of a foundational, a prioristic status of “uncontrollable interaction,” are illegitimate. The uncontrollability of interaction has one, and only one reason – it follows from the mathematical framework of the quantum theory. It is necessary to ensure the consistency of quantum theory, when measuring possibilities are taken into account. David Bohm, after his conversion took place, understood this clearly. Thus, discussing the “uncontrollability” of the interaction in Heisenberg's gamma-ray experiment, Bohm pointed out: “The disturbance is unpredictable and uncontrollable because from the existing quantum theory [italics are his] there is no way of knowing or controlling beforehand what will be the precise angle, with which the light quantum will be scattered into the lens.” (Bohm 1957). Bohm realizes that the indeterminacy relations are “primarily… a deduction from the quantum theory in its current form,” and that the attempts to prove its “absolute and final validity” are based on nothing else but on an a prioristic and illegitimate insistence on the finality of the quantum theory (Bohm 1957).
>
>The legitimate function of “uncontrollability” arguments is to establish the consistency, rather than the inevitability, of uncertainty and complementarity. Bohr does discuss certain canonical thought experiments along these more legitimate lines (Bohr 1935). He argues, for example, for the impossibility of measuring the position of a particle in a set-up measuring its momentum. Using a moveable diaphragm, we can measure a particle's momentum (by using an appropriate test body) before and after the passage of a particle through the slit (Bohr 1935). By applying the law of conservation of momentum to a system consisting of a particle and a moving diaphragm, we can calculate the momentum of a particle passing through the slit. However, because we have exact knowledge of the momentum of the diaphragm during, or immediately after, the particle's passage, we block the possibility of knowing also the position of the diaphragm, in accord with uncertainty relations. Consequently, we are denied a knowledge of particle's position, which is identical with that of diaphragm location. Why does the diaphragm obey the uncertainty relations? Either we just state it (it applies to quantum objects), and then we deduce the uncertainty for the particle (this is, of course, an argument of consistency), or we say that while measuring the momentum of the diaphragm with a test body, the diaphragm undergoes uncontrollable interaction. We deduce consequently the uncontrollable interaction between the particle and the diaphragm – again, these are elementary considerations of consistency.
>
>The crucial point of these thought experiments is that momentum and position cannot be measured simultaneously. This is however not satisfactory for Bohr. Why is it not satisfactory? The answer is clear from Bohr's own words. He warns against “misunderstanding by expressing the context of uncertainty relations… by a statement as ‘the position and momenta cannot simultaneously be measured with arbitrary accuracy’… such a formulation would not preclude the possibility of a future theory taking both attributes into account.” (Bohr 1937)
>
>What is the strategy of precluding a theory, such as Bohm's where particles have a well-defined positions and momenta, which however cannot be measured simultaneously according to the uncertainty relations? How do we argue that Bohm's theory is impossible in principle? How do we transform consistency arguments into those of inevitability?
>
>With the benefit of hindsight the answer is obvious. Simply postulate that what cannot be measured – does not exist. By defining concepts operationally through a procedure for their measurement, and then applying the quantum formalism to the analysis of the measurement procedure, we will obtain nothing else but deductions from the quantum formalism (such as, for example, the uncertainty relations). In this way an illusion is created that the features of the theory (such as uncertainty) belong to the very definition of the concepts used, and that they inevitably follow from a logical analysis of conditions of experience.
>
>The initial use of thought experiments by Heisenberg and Bohr was indeed to argue for the consistency of the new quantum-mechanical scheme. This was the original thrust and aim of Heisenberg's analysis in gamma-ray Gedanken experiment. Bohr, following Heisenberg, argued that uncertainty relations are “the basis of the thorough investigation of the logical consistency of quantum mechanics” (Bohr 1929).
>
>Bohr's considerations of mutually exclusive experimental arrangements were initially aimed at proving the consistency of quantum theory: the wave and particle aspects “can never be brought into direct contradiction… since they demand mutually exclusive arrangements” (Bohr 1933). This mutual exclusivity, aided by operationalism, soon developed into the arguments of inevitability of uncertainty and complementarity. This connection between operationalism and inevitability becomes substantially strengthened in Bohr's response to EPR. As Arthur Fine and I have argued (1994), the only way Bohr was able to counter the challenge of EPR was by the operational and relational definition of concepts. After EPR, operationalism became the central tool for the strongest case of legitimization arguments for the inevitability of quantum theory. It is in this context that Bohr often uses the word “logical” – the inevitability of complementarity and uncertainty follows, in his words, from “the simple logical analysis” and leads to “the situation where the very concept of determination loses its possibility of logical application” (Bohr 1957).
>
>With the “dictatorial help,” to use Schrödinger’s (1935) apt expression, of operationalism, the central Copenhagen dogmas become unassailable and final.
>
>Now we can return to Bohm's claim that it is the positivistic commitments of the founding fathers of the Copenhagen interpretation that led them to believe in the “finality” of the quantum theory, and the impossibility of revising it along more objective or deterministic lines. As in the case of the “inevitability” of classical concepts, the situation is a reversed one: it is the need, or the desire, to argue for finality against the threat of opposition, that led Heisenberg and Bohr to forcefully employ the operationalistic stand. I have argued (Beller 1996) that the proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation do not have, collectively or even individually, a consistent stand on the realism-antirealism issue, and that they employ different, often contradictory arguments, depending on the local context. We now have identified this context in which positivistic operationalistic arguments are selectively employed. Positivism in quantum philosophy has two central strands – that of operationalism, and of instrumentalism. Instrumentalism implies that the quantum formalism is merely a tool, an algorithm for the description and prediction of the measurement results. The instrumentalist stand, denying the possibility of a quantum ontology, while emphasizing the Kantian inevitability of the classical one, is, of course, directly connected with the doctrine of the indispensability of classical concepts. Both varieties of positivism – instrumentalism and operationalism – are aimed at arguing for the finality of quantum mechanics.
>
>Were physicists aware that, unless one takes an extreme and untenable positivistic stand, what the Copenhagen interpretation offered were at best considerations of consistency, and not of inevitability? After his conversion, I believe, David Bohm was aware of this. According to Bohm, Bohr's essential contribution was to demonstrate that one can “consistently [italics mine]… renounce the notion of unique and precisely defined conceptual models in favor of that of complementary pairs of imprecisely defined models” (1957). What Bohr was able to demonstrate was that such a use of complementary concepts provides “… a possible [italics mine] way of discussing the behavior of matter in the quantum-mechanical domains” (1957).
>
>Not only such dissidents as Bohm, but orthodox quantum physicists were also aware that many of the philosophical pronouncements on complementarity and uncertainty are merely consistency arguments. Wolfgang Pauli announced that the central function of the notion of complementarily is “to symbolize the fundamental limitation of our… idea of phenomena as existing independently of the means by which they are observed…. It is indeed this limitation that makes the theory logically consistent” [italics mine] (Pauli 1945). Paul Dirac, who was fond neither of pictures nor of complementarity, conceded that one may “extend the meaning of the word ‘picture’ to include any way of looking at the fundamental laws which make their self-consistency [italics mine] obvious" (quoted in Jammer 1974).
>
>Both Feynman and von Weizsäcker realized that Heisenberg's analysis of the gamma-ray experiment is only a consistency argument, despite the fact that it is often presented as an “inevitability” one. Feynman announced in his Physics Lectures: “it was suggested by Heisenberg that the new laws of nature could only be consistent [italics mine] if there were some basic limitation on our experimental capabilities not previously recognized” (Feynman et al. 1965). And, more eloquently, von Weizsäcker: “the impossibility of simultaneously observing precise values of position and momentum does not mean the pseudo-positivistic nonsense ‘what cannot be observed does not exist,’ but the test of consistency: ‘what does not exist in the theory cannot be observed in an experiment describable by the same theory’” (von Weizsäcker 1987). In this argument von Weizsäcker was following his teacher Heisenberg who revealed that he considered all of Bohr's complementarity elaborations as demonstrating the consistency of the quantum formalism by an analysis of the possibilities of measurement. Heisenberg considered all these arguments “trivial”: “Many experiments were discussed, and Bohr again successfully used the two pictures, wave and particle, in the analysis. The results confirmed the validity of the relations of uncertainty, but in a way this outcome could be considered trivial, because if the process of observation is itself subject to the laws of quantum theory, it must be possible to represent its results in the mathematical scheme of this theory” (Heisenberg, 1973). This position undermines, of course, all of Heisenberg's own “inevitability,” or “finality,” arguments.
>
>The project of arriving at true, final, certain, indisputable knowledge was, of course, not a new one. Classical physics, despite the empiricist revolt against scholasticism, inherited the Aristotelian ideal of science as demonstration, of arriving at certain conclusions from certain premises. The “father of empiricism” himself, Galileo Galilei, used such scholastic demonstrative arguments: two bodies of unequal weight must fall at the same rate, for if they would not (if heavy bodies fall faster), we will arrive at the logical contradiction. Heisenberg's cut arguments are peculiarly reminiscent of such pseudological proofs.
>
>It was Kant, of course, who provided the most grandiose philosophical demonstration of an indubitable knowledge – by his analysis of Newtonian space and time as forms of intuition, and causality as a necessary category. Newtonian mechanics received the status of synthetic a priori knowledge – knowledge that, though empirically arrived at, had the same certainty as the analytic knowledge of Euclidean geometry.
>
>Bohr's attempts to arrive at a true, certain, final knowledge by a mere analysis of the conditions of experience is thoroughly Kantian in spirit. What is striking, however, is that all of these Kantian arguments were advanced after the full realization of the bankruptcy of such a priori knowledge (the theory of relativity being a final stroke), and by those physicists who, except Bohr himself, had a thorough knowledge of relativity theory. Only extra scientific reasons can, I believe, plausibly explain this fact. No wonder that what the orthodox physicists advanced as arguments of inevitability were, in the best case, arguments of consistency. It is enlightening to mention here the views of the Göttingen mathematician Hilbert, with whom mathematical quantum physicists were in close contact. Itamar Pitowsky referred to Hilbert's stand succinctly: “… consistency, or rather the avoidance of a paradox, is ultimately the only safeguard in the pursuit of knowledge. We would have liked to do better for sure, but we have very little choice in the matter” (Pitowsky 1994).
>
>The Copenhagen interpretation, and its rhetoric of inevitability, crucially depends on two central pillars – positivism and the doctrine of the necessity of the classical concepts. Both are unnatural for working mathematical physicists (Beller 1996). No wonder, Copenhagen-Göttingen physicists, Heisenberg included, often denied their adherence to positivism. No wonder, contradictory statements abound concerning the doctrine of the necessity of the classical concepts.


### Bohm on classical versus quantum concepts and on indeterminism [p. 223]

>How did the outstanding mathematical physicist David Bohm, fluent in relativity theory, deal with these issues before his conversion took place?
>
>Bohm's Quantum Theory is rightly considered as the best Bohrian textbook. Indeterminism, indivisibility and wave-particle duality – all are elaborated with rare clarity and force. The arguments are perfected as far as they possibly could – precisely because Bohm labored hard to make them as convincing as possible, he could not escape seeing their weak points. It is perhaps not incidental that both David Bohm and Alfred Landé, another prominent dissident, defected the orthodoxy after completing a textbook on quantum theory in the Copenhagen spirit.
>
>While the central pillars of the Copenhagen interpretation are elaborated faithfully in Bohm's textbook, a careful reading reveals substantial undercurrent tensions with Bohr – tensions that, when taken to their logical conclusion, should have, and historically could have, been the reason for Bohm's final break with the orthodoxy. Not surprisingly, these discrepancies concern Bohm's discussion of classical and quantum concepts. Bohm treats these issues in Chapter Eight, revealingly titled “An Attempt to Build a Physical Picture of the Quantum Nature of Matter” – wording which contains the hint at, and possibly a seed of, his future quantum ontology.
>
>As opposed to Bohr, Bohm does not argue that classical concepts are either indispensable, or even natural. In fact, a Bohmian analysis undermines Bohr's arguments that classical concepts are an extension of common sense. Nor does Bohm seem to agree with Bohr that there can be in principle “no quantum concepts,” only a quantum-mechanical abstract algorithm of prediction and description of experimental results. Bohm calls for the development of a new language, which will depart from the classical intuitions and will be adequate to the new quantum conceptual framework.
>
>Bohm undertook a thorough critical analysis of the classical idea of continuity of motion and of classical determinism. His aim is to demonstrate that “there is no a priori logical reason for their adoption” (Bohm 1951). Quantum concepts of indivisible transitions and incomplete determinism are “much more analogous to certain naive concepts that arise… in common experience” (1951). Not surprisingly, Greek philosophers were unable to grasp the idea of continuous motion, as Zeno paradoxes eloquently remind us (1951). In fact, our intuitions revolt against thinking of a motion in which the position and velocity are both precisely determined, and are thus in close harmony with the uncertainty principle. By the use of photography, this becomes especially clear. Our simplest intuition of an object with a definite position is that the object is not moving. To obtain a picture of movement, we must allow the position to blur slightly. It is the blurred picture of the speeding car which suggests that some space was covered during some time, that the car is moving. If we use a very fast camera and will get a sharp picture of the moving car, we will not deduce motion. Our intuitive presupposition is that “a continuously moving object has a somewhat indefinite range of positions” – we simply “cannot visualize simultaneously a particle having a definite momentum and position” (Bohm 1951). Bohm concludes that “quantum theory… gives a picture of the process of motion that is considerably closer to our simplest concepts than does classical theory” (Bohm 1951).
>
>But does not our concept of an object at rest, with fixed position and zero velocity, contradict the uncertainty principle, according to which an object with a precise position has a completely indefinite momentum? Bohm argues that in fact there is no contradiction. When we think of an object at a definite position, we can imagine that in a short time later it will move to a different position. Which position it will move to we cannot infer from the original position – all positions are equally consistent with it. This means that any velocity, or any value of momentum, is equally consistent with a picture of a particle in a definite position. Put differently, “if we think of an object in a given position, we simply cannot think of its velocity at the same time” (Bohm 1951).
>
>We see that the classical idea of continuity of motion is an unnatural, non-commonsensical idea. On a purely logical basis, there is no reason to choose the concept of a continuous trajectory in preference to that of discontinuous trajectory. The idea of continuous motion developed through experience with planetary orbits, gun trajectories, and by the theory of differential calculus, aimed at dealing with such motions. It is only by studying “such things for a while” and getting used to them that the “succeeding generation began to take the basic ideas for granted” (Bohn 1951). This analysis is of course a far cry from Bohr's position of the necessity of classical concepts because of the alleged proximity of classical to common sense notions, and of a direct accessibility of classical reality to our immediate sense perception.
>
>According to Bohm, there are quantum concepts that are inherently different from the classical ones. Quantum energy and momentum, despite the same names as in the classical physics, are such concepts. In classical theory, we regard energy and momentum as fundamental properties of matter, because they obey conservation laws. But from a logical point of view they need not be considered fundamental, because energy and momentum can be expressed as functions of positions and velocities, so they are in certain sense redundant. All the classical laws of motion can be expressed in terms of space-time relationships alone.
>
>This is not the case in quantum theory. In quantum theory, velocity cannot be defined as a limit of distance divided by time. In quantum theory, momentum, defined by the de Broglie relation, is to be considered as an independent, rather than a derived, property of matter – “the statement that an election was observed to have a given momentum… stands on the same footing as the statement that it had a given position. Neither statement is subject to further analysis” (Bohm 1951).
>
>Bohm departs from Bohr also in his relation to the issue of classical versus quantum mechanical reality. He uses the word “convenient,” rather than the Copenhagen “necessary,” to differentiate between classical and quantum processes: “… it is convenient to make a distinction between classically describable processes and those essentially quantum-mechanical in nature” (Bohm 1951). Such a distinction is convenient when we deal with large objects, whose features of interest “do not critically depend on the transfer of few quanta more or less” (Bohm 1951). In a direct, though unacknowledged, contradiction to Bohr, Bohm asserts: “In the last analysis all processes are, of course, quantum-mechanical in nature” (Bohm 1951).
>
>It is very enlightening to see how Bohm argues against classical Laplacian determinism. By presenting classical determinism as an historically contingent, rather than a necessary notion, Bohm aims to ease the way for the acceptance of indeterminism. Yet, precisely because of its historical contingency, Bohm implicitly undermines the Copenhagen stand of “inevitability” of indeterminism. Bohm argues for replacing the notion of classical determinism with a more limited notion of causality as determining general tendencies (but not determining the behavior of systems completely). Such a notion is much closer to the way we relate to forces, or causes, in everyday life: “The idea most likely to have been used in connection with common experience is that a particular force or cause produces a tendency toward an effect, but that it does not guarantee the effect” (Bohm 1951). Quantum lawfulness, which determines only statistical trends, is much closer to our common sense than complete determinism (Bohm 1951).
>
>Bohm offers a brief critical historical analysis of the idea of classical determinism. The Greek idea of “fate” – the course of events which is beyond the power of humans to change – belongs to one of the earliest ideas of complete determinism. Yet it is only with the invention of machinery, which allowed the control of motion with precision, that the idea of a mechanistic and deterministic world view developed in the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. When work was done mostly by hand or by aid of animals, one could not control motions exactly – one could push in the right general direction, and push backward if one had gone too far. “It is very likely that the modem form of the idea of complete determinism was suggested… by its resemblance to complex and precisely constructed machines, such as clocks” (Bohm 1951).
>
>Bohm 's analysis of machines – material means of production – as determining the basic conceptual framework of Newtonian mechanics, resembles the analysis of the Soviet historian of science Boris Hessen, who in 1931 at the Congress in London, launched the Marxist historiography of science by an analysis of Newtonian mechanics along similar lines (Hessen 1931). It would be rewarding to know whether Bohm was acquainted with the works of Marxist historians of science in general, and with Hessen's work in particular. Yet the crucial point here is the following: Bohm's analysis of historical rootedness, of socio-historical contingency of our most cherished, most uncritically accepted concepts, does not agree with the rhetoric of finality of the Copenhagen interpretation. What Bohm's analysis rather discloses is that nothing more than continuous habit endows concepts with the aura of naturalness, necessity, inevitability. It is only a small step from here to question whether the same kind of critical analysis cannot be extended, or will not be extended in the future, to the Copenhagen quantum framework itself. Even the idea of “hidden variables” surfaces favorably in this discussion (Bohm 1951). Let us also mention that Bohm, in his later quantum ontology, is open on the issue determinism-indeterminism. Bohm's non-local ontology can be either causal or stochastic. No wonder Bohm was soon led to his idea of understanding nature in terms of an inexhaustible diversity and multiplicity of things, and of understanding of scientific theory as approximate, conditional and relative truth (1957).
>
>How strikingly different from Bohr's ideas this trend of thought was! Bohr, who considered classical concepts as natural and necessary, and who considered quantum theory “a rational generalization” of the classical one, could honestly believe (as opposed, perhaps, to the more opportunistic Heisenberg), that his analysis of quantum theory is really the only one possible. He was impatient with those who questioned him: “How could philosophers not understand, that his was an objective description, and the only possible objective description” (Interview with Kuhn and letter to Born, 1953, at AHOP). As an official spokesman of the orthodox interpretation, who had to fight against the threat of opposition, such as Bohm, Bohr preached closure, finality, inevitability, the impossibility of an alternative. How fitting for Bohm, a victim of such an approach, to develop a diametrically opposed view of science – the one pleading for tolerance, for creative plurality, for peaceful theoretical coexistence, for a free play of imagination, for friendly, open-minded and joyful scientific cooperation and communication (Bohm and Peat 1987).



### Comments on Bohr’s authority and conclusion [p. 227]

>Why were Bohm's valuable ideas ignored? Why were Niels Bohr's ideas considered indisputable, and why, with rare exception, did those, who might have had reservations about them, not challenge Bohr openly? Why did those scientists, who realized that certain arguments for uncertainty and acausality are those of consistency, and not of inevitability, not extend the critical analysis to the whole Copenhagen framework?
>
>The answer lies neither in physics nor in philosophy, but, as Alfred Landé perceptively put it, in “social psychology” (Interview with Landé, AHQP). The nature of Bohr's authority is a crucial ingredient of such a social analysis. I cannot attempt this analysis here, providing instead a few characteristic examples of the grip of Bohr's authority – examples that are eloquent enough to speak for themselves.
>
>Hendrik Casimir, a physicist from Bohr's circle, wrote a comical poem for Bohr's 50th birthday. He described Bohr's infamous theory about the advantages of defensive, as opposed to aggressive shooting, because supposedly making a voluntary decision takes more time than reacting in a purely mechanical way. The poem concludes with the attempt to give Bohr a gun so that he will prove his theory “experimentally” by defending himself. […]
>
>The moral of the story is clear. Nothing positive awaits those who will dare to challenge Bohr's authority. But is not such a literary interpretation inconclusive and tendentious, misrepresenting the joyful and humorous atmosphere in Copenhagen? Clearly not, for let us quote Casimir's own sober interpretation of poem: “… the moral of the story that one should not doubt the wisdom of Bohr applies to more important things than shooting gunmen in Westerns” (Casimir 1967).
>
>Bohr's unpublished correspondence discloses an overbearing guilt experienced by those physicists who dared to challenge Bohr. […]
>
>Such was the parental authority of Bohr, that many physicists, among them Pauli and Jordan, referred to Bohr by the word “Vater” (father).
>
>Many could not trespass the psychological barrier of even beginning to criticize Bohr. Thus, Du Mond wrote to Bohr of his numerous but unsuccessful attempts to grasp the meaning of Bohr's writings:
>
>>“This is of course not the first time I have read and tried to grasp your point of view… regarding your viewpoint I have never been able to get a clear answer from others. I hasten to say that I do not mean to imply any shortcomings in your own written exposition and am very ready to admit that the difficulty is entirely the fault of my own slowness and dullness.” (Du Mond to Bohr, March 7, 1961, AHQP)
>
>Yet von Weizsäcker's reminiscences about his first encounter with Bohr constitute perhaps the best evidence for the overpowering, almost disabling, impact of Bohr's authority. After the meeting with Bohr, von Weizsäcker, in his own words, asked himself: “What had Bohr meant? What must I understand to be able to tell what he meant and why was he right? [italics mine] I tortured myself on endless solitary walks” (von Weizsäcker 1985, 185). The question was not: “was Bohr right?” or, “to what an extent was Bohr right?” or, “on what issues was Bohr right?,” but, quite incredibly, “what one must assume and in what way one must argue in order to render Bohr right.” The times when it was unimaginable, or at least “politically incorrect,” to challenge Bohr's wisdom, have passed. The present volume on Bohmian mechanics is a telling testimony to this fact.
