### The identity of indiscernibles [p. 2]

>B. All you are saying is that b is different from a. I think the form of words “a is different from b” does have the advantage over “a is a” that it might be used to give information. I might learn from hearing it used that ‘a’' and ‘b’ were applied to different things. But this is not what you want to say, since you are trying to use the names, not mention them. When I already know what ‘a’ and ‘b’ stand for, “a is different from b” tells me nothing. It, too, is a useless tautology.
>
>A. I wouldn't have expected you to treat ‘tautology’ as a term of abuse. Tautology or not, the sentence has a philosophical use. It expresses the necessary truth that different things have at least one property not in common. Thus different things must be discernible; and hence, by contraposition, indiscernible things must be identical. Q.E.D.
>
>B. Why obscure matters by this old-fashioned language? By “indiscernible” I suppose you mean the same as “having all properties in common”. Do you claim to have proved that two things having all their properties in common are identical?
>
>A. Exactly. […]
>
>A. In that case, I don’t need to count identity and difference as properties. Here is a different argument that seems to me quite conclusive. The only way we can discover that two different things exist is by finding out that one has a quality not possessed by the other or else that one has a relational characteristic that the other hasn't.
>
>If both are blue and hard and sweet and so on, and have the same shape and dimensions and are in the same relations to everything in the universe, it is logically impossible to tell them apart. The supposition that in such a case there might really be two things would be unverifiable in principle. Hence it would be meaningless.
>
>B. You are going too fast for me.
>
>A. Think of it this way. If the principle were false, the fact that I can see only two of your hands would be no proof that you had just two. And even if every conceivable test agreed with the supposition that you had two hands, you might all the time have three, four, or any number. You might have nine hands, different from one another and all indistinguishable from your left hand, and nine more all different from each other but indistinguishable from your right hand. And even if you really did have just two hands, and no more, neither you nor I nor anybody else could ever know that fact. This is too much for me to swallow. This is the kind of absurdity you get into, as soon as you abandon verifiability as a test of meaning.
>
>B. Far be it from me to abandon your sacred cow. Before I give you a direct answer, let me try to describe a counterexample.
>
>Isn’t it logically possible that the universe should have contained nothing but two exactly similar spheres? We might suppose that each was made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, that they had the same temperature, colour, and so on, and that nothing else existed. […]
>
>A. How eloquent, and how unconvincing! But since you seem to have convinced yourself, at least, perhaps you can explain another thing that bothers me: I don’t see that you have a right to talk as you do about places or spatial relations in connexion with your so-called “universe”. So long as we are talking about our own universe – the universe – I know what you mean by “distance”, “diameter”, “place” and so on. But in what you want to call a universe, even though it contains only two objects, I don’t see what such words could mean. So far as I can see, you are applying these spatial terms in their present usage to a hypothetical situation which contradicts the presuppositions of that usage.
>
>B. What do you mean by “presupposition”?
>
>A. Well, you spoke of measured distances, for one thing. Now this presupposes some means of measurement. Hence your “universe” must contain at least a third thing – a ruler or some other measuring device.
>
>B. Axe you claiming that a universe must have at least three things in it? What is the least number of things required to make a world?
>
>A. No, all I am saying is that you cannot describe a configuration as spatial unless it includes at least three objects. This is part of the meaning of “spatial” – and it is no more mysterious than saying you can’t have a game of chess without there existing at least thirty-five things (thirty-two pieces, a chessboard, and two players).
>
>B. If this is all that bothers you, I can easily provide for three or any number of things without changing the force of my counter-example. The important thing, for my purpose, was that the configuration of two spheres was symmetrical. So long as we preserve this feature of the imaginary universe, we can now allow any number of objects to be found in it.
>
>A. You mean any even number of objects.
>
>B. Quite right. Why not imagine a plane running clear through space, with everything that happens on one side of it always exactly duplicated at an equal distance in the other side.
>
>A. A kind of cosmic mirror producing real images.
>
>B. Yes, except that there wouldn’t be any mirror! The point is that in this world we can imagine any degree of complexity and change to occur. No reason to exclude rulers, compasses, and weighing machines. No reason, for that matter, why the Battle of Waterloo shouldn’t happen.
>
>A. Twice over, you mean – with Napoleon surrendering later in two different places simultaneously!
>
>B. Provided you wanted to call both of them “Napoleon”.
>
>A. So your point is that everything could be duplicated on the other side of the non-existent Looking Glass. I suppose whenever a man got married, his identical twin would be marrying the identical twin of the first man’s fiancée?
>
>B. Exactly.
>
>A. Except that “identical twins” wouldn’t be numerically identical?
>
>B. You seem to be agreeing with me.
>
>A. Far from it. This is just a piece of gratuitous metaphysics. If the inhabitants of your world had enough sense to know what was sense and what wasn’t, they would never suppose all the events in their world were duplicated. It would be much more sensible for them to regard the “second” Napoleon as a mere mirror image – and similarly for all the other supposed “duplicates”.
>
>B. But they could walk through the “mirror” and find water just as wet, sugar just as sweet, and grass just as green on the other side.
>
>A. You don’t understand me. They would not postulate “another side”. A man looking at the “mirror” would be seeing himself, not a duplicate. If he walked in a straight line toward the “mirror” he would eventually find himself back at his starting point, not at a duplicate of his starting point. This would involve their having a different geometry from ours – but that would be preferable to the logician’s nightmare of the reduplicated universe.
>
>B. They might think so – until the twins really began to behave differently for the first time!
>
>A. Now it's you who are tinkering with your supposition. You can’t have your universe and change it too.
>
>B. All right, I retract.
>
>A. The more I think about your “universe” the queerer it seems. What would happen when a man crossed your invisible “mirror”? While he was actually crossing, his body would have to change shape, in order to preserve the symmetry. Would it gradually shrink to nothing and then expand again?
>
>B. I confess I hadn’t thought of that.
>
>A. And here is something that explodes the whole notion. Would you say that one of the two Napoleons in your universe had his heart in the right place – literally, I mean?
>
>B. Why, of course.
>
>A. In that case his “mirror-image” twin would have the heart on the opposite side of the body. One Napoleon would have his heart on the left of his body, and the other would have it on the right of his body.
>
>B. It’s a good point, though it would still make objects like spheres indistinguishable. But let me try again. Let me abandon the original idea of a plane of symmetry and to suppose instead that we have only a centre of symmetry. I mean that everything that happened at anyplace would be exactly duplicated at a place an equal distance on the opposite side of the centre of symmetry. In short, the universe would be what the mathematicians call “radially symmetrical”. And to avoid complications we could suppose that the centre of symmetry itself was physically inaccessible, so that it would be impossible for any material body to pass through it. Now in this universe, identical twins would have to be either both right-handed or both left-handed.
>
>A. Your universes are beginning to be as plentiful as blackberries. You are too ingenious to see the force of my argument about verifiability. Can’t you see that your supposed description of a universe in which everything has its “identical twin” doesn’t describe anything verifiably different from a corresponding universe without such duplication? This must be so, no matter what kind of symmetry your universe manifested.
>
>B. You are assuming that in order to verify that there are two things of a certain kind, it must be possible to show that one has a property not possessed by the other. But this is not so. A pair of very close but similar magnetic poles produce a characteristic field of force which assures me that there are two poles, even if I have no way of examining them separately. The presence of two exactly similar stars at a great distance might be detected by some resultant gravitational effect or by optical interference – or in some such similar way – even though we had no way of inspecting one in isolation from the other. Don’t physicists say something like this about the electrons inside an atom? We can verify that there are two, that is to say a certain property of the whole configuration, even though there is no way of detecting any character that uniquely characterises any element of the configuration.
>
>A. But if you were to approach your two stars one would have to be on your left and one on the right. And this would distinguish them.
>
>B. I agree. Why shouldn’t we say that the two stars are distinguishable –meaning that it would be possible for an observer to see one on his left and the other on his right, or more generally, that it would be possible for one star to come to have a relation to a third object that the second star would not have to that third object.
>
>A. So you agree with me after all.
>
>B. Not if you mean that the two stars do not have all their properties in common. All I said was that it was logically possible for them to enter into different relationships with a third object. But this would be a change in the universe.
>
>A. If you are right, nothing unobserved would be observable. For the presence of an observer would always change it, and the observation would always be an observation of something else.
>
>B. I don’t say that every observation changes what is observed. My point is that there isn’t any being to the right or being to the left in the two-sphere universe until an observer is introduced, that is to say until a real change is made.
>
>A. But the spheres themselves wouldn’t have changed.
>
>B. Indeed they would: they would have acquired new relational characteristics. In the absence of any asymmetric observer, I repeat, the spheres would have all their properties in common (including, if you like, the power to enter into different relations with other objects). Hence the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is false.
>
>A. So perhaps you really do have twenty hands after all?
>
>B. Not a bit of it. Nothing that I have said prevents me from holding that we can verify that there are exactly two. But we could know that two things existed without there being any way to distinguish one from the other. The Principle is false.
>
>A. I am not surprised that you ended in this way, since you assumed it in the description of your fantastic “universe”. Of course, if you began by assuming that the spheres were numerically different though qualitatively alike, you could end by “proving” what you first assumed.
>
>B. But I wasn’t “proving” anything. I tried to support my contention that it is logically possible for two things to have all their properties in common by giving an illustrative description. (Similarly, if I had to show it is logically possible for nothing at all to be seen I would ask you to imagine a universe in which everybody was blind.) It was for you to show that my description concealed some hidden contradiction. And you haven’t done so.
>
>A. All the same I am not convinced.
>
>B. Well, then, you ought to be.


### Notes [p. 12]

>The following notes and references might be helpful to anybody wishing to make up his own mind on the questions raised:
>
>The Definition of Identity: See Principia Mathematica. The theory of types required Whitehead and Russell to say x and y are identical if and only if the same predicative functions are satisfied by both. For a similar definition see Quine, Mathematical Logic. See also Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic (1940).
>
>Self-evidence of the Principle: “I think it is obvious that the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is not true” (Moore, Philosophical Studies, 1922). “Leibniz’s, ‘principles of indiscernibles’ is all nonsense. No doubt, all things differ; but there is no logical necessity for it” (Peirce, Collected Papers). “Russell’s definition of ‘=’ won’t do; because according to it one cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common (even if this proposition is never true, it is nevertheless significant).” (Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus). See also Langford, “Otherness and dissimilarity” (1930).
>
>Bradley’s remark: Not made in connexion with this topic. Bradley affirmed what he called “the Axiom of the Identity of Indiscernibles” (The Principles of Logic, 1928).
>
>Identity as a relational property: “. . . numerical identity, which is a dyadic relation of a subject to itself of which nothing but an existent individual is capable” (Peirce, Collected Papers).
>
>The proof of the principle by treating identity as a property: “It should be observed that by ‘indiscernibles’ he [Leibniz] cannot have meant two objects which agree as to all their properties, for one of the properties of x is to be identical with x, and therefore this property would necessarily belong to y if x and y agreed in all their properties. Some limitation of the common properties necessary to make things indiscernible is therefore implied by the necessity of an axiom” (Principia Mathematica). See Grelling, “Identitas indiscernibilium” in Erkenntnis (1936).
>
>Counter-examples: Broad tries to refute McTaggart’s form of the principle (“The dissimilarity of the diverse”) by the example of a universe consisting of two minds, without bodies, that are exactly alike in all respects. (Examination of McTaggart’s Philosophy). Broad holds however, that “either spatial or temporal separation involves dissimilarity”.
>
>The argument from verifiability: “To say that B and C are ‘really’ two, although they seem one, is to say something which, if B and C are totally indistinguishable, seems wholly devoid of meaning” (Russell, An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, 1940).
>
>The distinguishability of asymmetric bodies and their mirror images: There is a famous discussion of this in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.
