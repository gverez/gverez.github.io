## Bohmian mechanics as the foundation of quantum mechanics <a name="arkhe"></a>
*With Sheldon Goldstein and Nino Zanghi, Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Introduction [p. 21]
>In order to arrive at Bohmian mechanics from standard nonrelativistic quantum mechanics one need do almost nothing! One need only complete the usual quantum description in what is really the most obvious way: by simply including the positions of the particles of a quantum system as part of the state description of that system, allowing these positions to evolve in the most natural way. The entire quantum formalism, including the uncertainty principle and quantum randomness, emerges from an analysis of this evolution. This can be expressed succinctly – though in fact not succinctly enough – by declaring that the essential innovation of Bohmian mechanics is the insight that particles move!



### Bohmian mechanics is minimal [p. 21]

>Bell 1987:
>
>>“Is it not clear from the smallness of the scintillation on the screen that we have to do with a particle? And is it not clear, from the diffraction and interference patterns, that the motion of the particle is directed by a wave? De Broglie showed in detail how the motion of a particle, passing through just one of two holes in screen, could be influenced by waves propagating through both holes. And so influenced that the particle does not go where the waves cancel out, but is attracted to where they cooperate. This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored.”
>
>According to orthodox quantum theory, the complete description of a system of particles is provided by its wave function. This statement is somewhat problematical: If "particles" is intended with its usual meaning – point-like entities whose most important feature is their position in space – the statement is clearly false, since the complete description would then have to include these positions; otherwise, the statement is, to be charitable, vague. Bohmian mechanics is the theory that emerges when we indeed insist that "particles" means particles.



### Bohmian mechanics and classical physics [p. 27]

>Moreover, when classical physics was first propounded by Newton, this theory, invoking as it did action-at-a-distance, did not provide an explanation in familiar terms. Even less intuitive was Maxwell's electrodynamics, insofar as it depended upon the reality of the electromagnetic field. We should recall in this regard the lengths to which physicists, including Maxwell, were willing to go in trying to provide an intuitive explanation for this field as some sort of disturbance in a material substratum to be provided by the Ether. These attempts of course failed, but even had they not, the success would presumably have been accompanied by a rather drastic loss of mathematical simplicity. In the present century fundamental physics has moved sharply away from the search for such intuitive explanations in favor of explanations having an air of mathematical simplicity and naturalness, if not inevitability, and this has led to an astonishing amount of progress. It is particularly important to bear these remarks on intuitive explanation in mind when we come to the discussion in the next section of the status of quantum observables, especially spin.

>The problem with orthodox quantum theory is not that it is unintuitive. Rather the problem is that “… conventional formulations of quantum theory, and of quantum field theory in particular, are unprofessionally vague and ambiguous. Professional theoretical physicists ought to be able to do better. Bohm has shown us a way.” (Bell 1987)
>
>The problem, in other words, with orthodox quantum theory is not that it fails to be intuitively formulated, but rather that, with its incoherent babble about measurement, it is not even well formulated!



### What about quantum observables? [p. 27]

>We have argued that quantities such as mass do not have the same meaning in Bohmian mechanics as they do classically. This is not terribly surprising if we bear in mind that the meaning of theoretical entities is ultimately determined by their role in a theory, and thus when there is a drastic change of theory, a change in meaning is almost inevitable. We would now like to argue that with most observables, for example energy and momentum, something much more dramatic occurs: In the transition from classical mechanics they cease to remain properties at all. Observables, such as spin, that have no classical counterpart also should not be regarded as properties of the system. The best way to understand the status of these observables – and to better appreciate the minimality of Bohmian mechanics – is Bohr's way: what are called quantum observables obtain meaning only through their association with specific experiments. We believe that Bohr's point has not been taken to heart by most physicists, even those who regard themselves as advocates of the Copenhagen interpretation, and that the failure to appreciate this point nourishes a kind of naive realism about operators, an uncritical identification of operators with properties, that is the source of most, if not all, of the continuing confusion concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics.



### The quantum equilibrium hypothesis [p. 36]

>However, the justification of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis is a problem that by its very nature can be adequately addressed only on the universal level. To better appreciate this point, one should perhaps reflect upon the fact that the same thing is true for the related problem of understanding the origin of thermodynamic nonequilibrium (!) and irreversibility. As Feynman has said, “Another delight of our subject of physics is that even simple and idealized things, like the ratchet and pawl, work only because they are part of the universe. The ratchet and pawl works in only one direction because it has some ultimate contact with the rest of the universe…. Its one-way behavior is tied to the one-way behavior of the entire universe.” (Feynman 1963)
>
>An argument establishing the convergence to quantum equilibrium for local systems, if it is not part of an argument explaining universal quantum equilibrium, would leave open the possibility that conditions of local equilibrium would tend to be overwhelmed, on the occasions when they do briefly obtain, by interactions with an ambient universal nonequilibrium. In fact, this is precisely what does happen with thermodynamic equilibrium. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that while we of course live in a universe that is not in universal thermodynamic equilibrium, a fact that is crucial to everything we experience, all available evidence supports universal quantum equilibrium. Were this not so, we should expect to be able to achieve violations of the quantum formalism – even for small systems. Indeed, we might expect the violations of universal quantum equilibrium to be as conspicuous as those of thermodynamic equilibrium.
>
>Moreover, there are some crucial subtleties here, which we can begin to appreciate by first asking the question: Which systems should be governed by Bohmian mechanics? The systems which we normally consider are subsystems of a larger system – for example, the universe – whose behavior (the behavior of the whole) determines the behavior of its subsystems (the behavior of the parts). Thus for a Bohmian universe, it is only the universe itself which a priori – i.e., without further analysis – can be said to be governed by Bohmian mechanics. […]

>As Einstein has emphasized (Einstein 1953) “Nature as a whole can only be viewed as an individual system, existing only once, and not as a collection of systems.”
>
>While Einstein's point is almost universally accepted among physicists, it is also very often ignored, even by the same physicists. We therefore elaborate: What possible physical significance can be assigned to an ensemble of universes, when we have but one universe at our disposal, the one in which we happen to reside? We cannot perform the very same experiment more than once. But we can perform many similar experiments, differing, however, at the very least, by location or time. In other words, insofar as the use of probability in physics is concerned, what is relevant is not sampling across an ensemble of universes, but sampling across space and time within a single universe. What is relevant is empirical distributions – actual relative frequencies for an ensemble of actual events.
