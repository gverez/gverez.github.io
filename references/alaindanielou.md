## Introduction to the study of musical scales <a name="titre"></a>
*India Society, 1943*

### Metaphysical correspondences

>The idea that all sciences are originally experimental is so dear to Occidentals that they do not even notice that all the elements of their musical system are symbolic, as also are almost all their ways of measuring time and space, and that, if those elements appear to us as natural, it is only because of the correspondence between those symbols and the perceptible world. We find in writings, which we should expect to be scientific, the poetic story, decorated with sentimental details, of the good savage who, having cut a bamboo and blown through it, discovers the diatonic scale as defined by Zarlino, which is supposed to be the “natural scale”. Such stories are without any foundation and simply show the complete ignorance of those writers as to the thousands of scales which are possible, expressive, pleasant to the ear and perfectly natural and legitimate.

>According to Tong Tschung-chu (2nd century B.C.): “[…] The fact of harmony between Heaven and Earth and Man does not come from a physical union, from a direct action, it comes from a tuning on the same note producing vibrations in unison… In the Universe there is no hazard, there is no spontaneity; all is influence and harmony, accord answering accord.” […]
>
>As Mr. René Guénon explains: “The affirmation of the perpetuity of Veda is directly connected with the cosmological theory of the primordiality of sound among sensible qualities (sound being the particular quality of Ether, which is the first element). And this theory is, in reality nothing else than that which is expressed in other traditions when ‘creation by the word’ is spoken of. The primordial sound is the divine word through which, according to the first chapter of Hebrew Genesis, all things have been made. This is why it is said that the Rsis or sages of the ages ‘heard’ the Veda. Revelation, being a work of the Verb, as creation itself, is actually a hearing for him who receives it.” […]
>
>M. René Guénon, in an article on the language of birds explains: “The (Vedic) hymns were given the name of chhandas, a word which properly means ‘rhythm’. The same idea is contained also in the word dhikr which, in Islamic esotericism, applies to rhythmic formulas exactly corresponding to the Hindu mantras. The purpose of the repetition of such formulas is to produce an harmonization of diverse elements of being and to determine vibrations susceptible, by their re-percussion across the series of stages in indefinite hierarchy, to open some communication with superior stages which is, as a rule, the essential and primordial purpose of every rite.” […]
>
>Evocation through sound, as creation itself, takes place not because of the material fact of physical vibration but on account of the existence of metaphysical correspondences. Therefore all psychological explanation of musical experience has to be discarded. In reality, the personality of the hearer counts for nothing in the phenomenon of musical evocation, because evocation takes place even if there is no hearer; and if the existence of this evocation is ephemeral it is only because of the imperfection of the relation of sounds. Hearers can only be differentiated negatively by the relative acuteness of their perceptions, their greater or lesser deafness. “Several centuries before Plato, Pythagoras, imbued with Egyptian doctrine, requested his disciples to reject the judgment of their ear as susceptible to error and variation wherever harmonic principles are concerned. He wanted them to regulate those immovable principles only on the proportional and analogical harmony of numbers.” (Fabre d’Olivet) […]
>
>In conformity with the formula of the Tao-te King “One has given birth to two, two has given birth to three, three has given birth to all numbers,” the original sound produces first its octave (2/1), giving the dual, then a third sound, the fifth (3/2), from which all other sounds are born. Among these sounds, in indefinite number, we must select a few whose respective ratios are adequate for the representation of the world in which we are living. In this way has been formed the scale of 5 sounds, corresponding to the material world, to the 5 directions of space (4 directions and the center), the 5 elements, etc. This is the basis upon which develops the whole system of the harmony of fifths which, through their revolutions, form, within the octave, first a series of 12 sounds, then a series of 52 sounds, and, finally, a series of 60 sounds. […]
>
>To these five principal sounds are added two auxiliary ones which form the scale of seven notes, image of the celestial world, to which correspond, in the world of spheres, the seven visible planets. “The soul of the world is divided into seven parts,” said Plato in his Timaeos. And this is why it was the seven stringed lyra which symbolized the beauty or the order (harmony) of the spheres. Each string of the lyra was related to a planet. The musical sounds themselves were given the names of planets. And, “because the mathematical laws observed in musical art and in cosmic spheres are related to the natural rhythms of the soul,” (Paul Vulliaud) music forms a logical and direct tie between the movements of the world and the movements of our soul.
>
>The symbolic ladder by which Dante rose up to the supreme light had also 7 steps which are “the printed steps of the eternal power which is the end for which the order of things are made” (Dante). “But what are these steps? They are precisely the different aspects assumed by this eternal power on which the order of the Universe rests; they are the seven differentiations of the one light, the seven colors of the prism and of the rainbow, the seven sounds contained in the primordial sound, the seven luminaries by which is reflected on our Earth the light of the eternal Great Luminary which shines in the centre of immensities” (Argos). They are the seven horses which drag the chariot of the Hindu Surya. The union of the ternary and the quaternary, the sevenfold (4+3), symbol of the soul of the world, was represented by the seven pipes of the flute of Pan, the God of the Universe.
>
>Assimilated to the seven planets, the seven notes move across the twelve regions of the octave, corresponding to the Zodiacal signs, in which, as we shall see later, these 7 notes will occupy 22 main positions (a number which is, in certain cases, reduced to 17). We shall also see why the twelve regions of the octave cannot be assimilated to twelve fixed sounds as has been attempted in the temperate scale. They determine the space in which the notes move but can in no case be taken for the notes themselves.
>
>“The number 12, formed by the combination of the ternary and the quaternary (3+4=12) [We can see here that the number 12 represents an area and not a sequence], is the symbol of the Universe and the measure of sounds… Pythagoras, Timaeos of Locres and Plato, when they gave the dodecahedron as the symbol of the Universe, only re-exposed the ideas of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks… The institution of the Zodiac is the result of the application of the number 12 to the Supreme Sphere… The number 12, so applied to the Universe and all its representations, was, always, the harmonic manifestation of the principles One and Two of the way in which their elements were co-ordinated. It was, therefore, also the symbol of the co-ordination of sounds, and, as such, applied to the lyra of Hermes.” (Fabre d’Olivet). […]
>
>On account of the imperfection which is at the very basis of the world existence, because if it were perfect it would immediately be reabsorbed into the infinite perfection, just as the heart of man is not in the centre of his chest, as the axis of the Earth is oblique, as the solar year does not coincide with the lunar year and thus are created the cycles by which all existence is conditioned and human destinies measured; so, in the same way, the development of twelve fifth (as that of the twelve months), instead of bringing back the octave, will leave a difference, the comma, with which we shall have to negotiate, which will make every calculation complicated, and which will prevent us from formulating those rigid and simple laws, attractive but inaccurate, in which our vain reason delights. This comma, which the modern world tries so hard to ignore, represents, for those who can understand it, all the difference between what is finite and what is indefinite. Those fifths form a spiral of which the sounds, coiled around themselves, can never meet. For us, this limitless spiral can be the joint in the structure of the world, the narrow gate, which will allow us also to escape from the appearance of a closed Universe, to travel in other worlds and to explore their secrets.

### The relations to a tonic

>From the point of view of numbers, the division of the modal octave must necessarily be of twenty-two intervals. This division is not particular to music, but represents a law of universal character. Effectively, the relation of those twenty-two intervals with the seven notes of the scale is the only one which can give to music a complete and logical under-structure. M. René Guénon explains:
>
>“The number twenty-two is related to seven by the ratio 22/7, which is the approximate expression of the relation between the circle and its diameter, so that the group of these two numbers represents the circle and its diameter, so that the group of these two numbers represents the circle, which is considered as the most perfect shape by Dante as well as by the Pythagoreans (and each division of each of the three worlds has this circular form): besides, in 22 are united the symbols of two of the “elementary movements” of Aristotelian physics: the local movement, represented by 2, and that of alteration, represented by 20, as Dante himself explains in his Convito.”
>
>The symbolic correspondences of the number seven and the number twenty-two are so numerous that it is not possible to attempt to study them here. We should only remember that the Hebrew alphabet, whose role is so important in the Kabbala, has also twenty-two letters and seven double letters and that, just as seven planets determine, by their orbits around the Sun, the limits of the visible world, in the same way also twenty-one cosmic circles separate us from the metaphysical sun, the central eye, which sees everything: circles which we shall have to cross, before we can reach the final resorption into absolute knowledge. The Arabic division of the octave into seventeen intervals is also based on considerations of symbolism connected with Musalman esotericism. This by no means excludes their physical actuality. […]
>
>The number seventeen, which was considered inauspicious in ancient times, in the Occident as well as in the Orient, has, on the contrary, been sometimes taken as representative of the new gospel, Christian or Musalman.
>>“The number seventeen can be divided in two ways; into ten and seven to represent the fusion of the ancient law and the new law (the law of fear is represented by the number ten, and the law of love by the number seven, says saint Augustine); it can also be divided into eight and nine, and, therefore, signifies the union of angels and men” (Bishop Hildephonse).
>
>>“One finds in the number seventeen… a wonderful mystery. It is not without reason that psalm seventeen is the only one to be found in the book of Kings, because it has for its subject the glory of the eternal kingdom in which we shall have no more enemies” (saint Augustine).
>
>On the other hand, Plutarch says:
>>“The Pythagoreans… have for the number seventeen an absolute and sacred repulsion. This is in relation to the fact that between the square number 16 and the rectangle number 18, which are the only plane numbers whose perimeters happen to be equal to their areas, comes the number 17, which interferes between these two numbers, separates them from each other, and divides their ratio, 1+1/8, into the unequal parts.” Effectively: 9/8=18/17x17/16.
>
>According to the Hindu Sankhya, the number seventeen represents the subtle body which is composed of the five principles of the elements, the five senses of perception, the five senses of action, intellect (in which the notion of individual ‘ego’, is included), and mind. 5+5+5+2=17.
>
This subtle body remains in existence through all the forms of posthumous life, and is destroyed only at the time of final liberation, which means complete resorption into the First Principle (Brahman).
>
>Therefore, the metaphysical doctrine (Pythagorean, and Vedantic) considers the subtle body as mortal, and even takes it as the fearful symbol of ultimate death. Whereas the religious doctrines, to which Christianity and Islam belong, and which do not envisage the final stage of liberation, but take Heaven to be the ultimate end, consider the subtle body, which is then called the soul, as immortal. The number seventeen, therefore, becomes the glorious symbol of immortality.

### The western scale and equal temperament

>More and more, Westerners have lost all conception of a music able to express clearly the highest ideas and feelings; they now expect from music mostly a confused noise, more or less agreeable, but able to arouse in the audience only the most ordinary sensations and simplified images. This is a complete misconception of the true role of music, “because music, whose movements are of the same kind as the regular revolutions of our soul, does not appear, to the man who has an intelligent intercourse with the Muses, to be good merely to give a physical pleasure, as seems to be the case in our days. On the contrary, the Muses have given music to us as an ally of our soul in its attempt to bring back order and harmony into those periodic movements which had become disorderly in us” (Plato, Timaeos). […]
>
>It is often proudly asserted that the actual Western musical system is sufficient to express everything, but the slightest true contact with other musical systems proves immediately the contrary. The power of evocation of the harmonic system, as it is conceived today, is weak and confused if compared with any modal system. It oscillates between abstractions and extremely conventional imitative harmonies; because what is called an imitation of a bird, the wind, the rain, a fountain, a factory, or any other much utilized subject, is, in reality, so far away from the model that a deep knowledge of musical conventions can become so familiar that one believes them to be realities and derives from them real pleasure; but any one unfamiliar with them could never guess what it is all about. The idea of representing natural phenomena, or the movements of things and beings, by imitating the noises they may make, appears to the Oriental childish, and is really a “primitive” conception, in the sense which is now-a-days given to this word. It is not the noise or the external appearance of things, but their essence, that the relations of sounds should be able to express. And it is the knowledge of those subtle relations which has always been considered, in the East, as the basis and the true object of Art. It is because of those relations that the effect of music can be so deep and directly perceptible without requiring any conventions or taxing the imagination of hearers. For example, when the Hindu mode of the rains, Megh-Mallar, is played, no sound will attempt to imitate the noise of rain drops or of thunder, but the relations between the sounds will be so similar to those between the elements when a storm is approaching, that not only trained musicians, but animals even, will inevitably feel the rain in the air.

### The scale of sounds

>To render the classifications of intervals easier, we have kept here, to represent certain intervals, the simpler ratios in which the numerical element “7” appears. From the point of view of the symbolic signification of numbers and, consequently, from the point of view of physics, this is an error. In this world limited to five elements, in which we live, no prime number higher than “5” can enter into the composition of the substance from which a melodic or an harmonic relation is made. The Chinese system, the abstract scale of fifths, even refuses to go beyond the number 3. All its intervals are expressed in terms of powers of 2 and 3. […]
>
>The number 5 “humanizes” music. It makes it the instrument of the expression no longer of abstract prototypes but of a tangible reality. The introduction of any higher prime number would take us beyond this reality into dangerous regions which are not within the scope of our normal perceptions and understanding. 7 is the number of the heavenly worlds as well as that of the internal regions, and we have usually no means of knowing to which side it may lead us.
>
>The intervals which contain the element 7 cannot be physically pleasant, being, by definition, beyond the limits of physical harmony; their magical effect also is normally beyond our control. Consequently, their utilization in music and its theory serves no useful purpose. We shall indicate some of them here merely as a reference and because they have been spoken of by many theorists past and present. […]
>
>The seven-note scale is thus taken to symbolize the transcendental role of music. The number “5” is the highest prime number utilized in harmonic intervals.
