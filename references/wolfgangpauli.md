## The influence of archetypal ideas on the scientific theories of Kepler <a name="titre"></a>
*The interpretation of nature and the psyche, Ishi Press 2012*

### Section 1 [p. 151]
>In contrast to the purely empirical conception according to which natural laws can with virtual certainty, be derived from the material of experience alone, many physicists have recently emphasized anew the fact that intuition and the direction of attention play a considerable role in the development of the concepts and ideas, generally far transcending mere experience, that are necessary for the erection of a system of natural laws (that is, scientific theory). From the standpoint of this not purely empiristic conception, which we also accept, there arises the question, What is the nature of the bridge between the sense perceptions and the concepts? All logical thinkers have arrived at the conclusion that pure logic is fundamentally incapable of constructing such a link. It seems most satisfactory to introduce at this point the postulate of a cosmic order independent of our choice and distinct from the world of phenomena. Whether one speaks of the “participation of natural things in ideas” or of a “behaviour of metaphysical things – those, that is, which are in themselves real,” the relation between sense perception and idea remains predicated upon the fact that both the soul of the perceiver and that which is recognized by perception are subject to an order thought to be objective. […]

>The process of understanding nature as well as the happiness that man feels in understanding, that is, in the conscious realization of new knowledge, seems thus to be based on a correspondence, a “matching” of inner images pre-existent in the human psyche with external objects and their behaviour. This interpretation of scientific knowledge, of course, goes back to Plato and is, as we shall see, very clearly advocated by Kepler. He speaks in fact of ideas that are pre-existent in the mind of God and were implanted in the soul, the image of God, at the time of creation. These primary images which the soul can perceive with the aid of an innate “instinct” are called by Kepler archetypal (“archetypalis”). Their agreement with the “primordial images” or archetypes introduced into modern psychology by C. G. Jung and functioning as “instincts of imagination” is very extensive. When modern psychology brings proof to show that all understanding is a long-drawn-out process initiated by processes in the unconscious long before the content of consciousness can be rationally formulated, it has directed attention again to the preconscious, archaic level of cognition. On this level the place of clear concepts is taken by images with strong emotional content, not thought out but beheld, as it were, while being painted. Inasmuch as these images are an “expression of a dimly suspected but still unknown state of affairs” they can also be termed symbolical, in accordance with the definition of the symbol proposed by C. G. Jung. As ordening operators and image-formers in this world of symbolical images, the archetypes thus function as the sought-for bridge between the sense perceptions and the ideas and are, accordingly, a necessary pre-supposition even for evolving a scientific theory of nature. However, one must guard against transferring this a priori of knowledge into the conscious mind and relating it to the definite ideas capable of rational formulation.

### Section 2 [p. 154]
>For the purpose of illustrating the relationship between archetypal ideas and scientific theories of nature Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) seemed to me especially suitable, since his ideas represent a remarkable intermediary stage between the earlier, magical-symbolical and the modern, quantitive-mathematical descriptions of nature. […]

>In Kepler’s view the planets are still living entities endowed with individual souls. Since the earth had lost its unique position among the planets he had to postulate also an anima terrae. We shall see how the souls of the heavenly bodies play an essential role in Kepler’s particular views on astrology. Yet the de-animation of the physical world had already begun to operate in Kepler’s thought. He does, to be sure, occasionally mention the alchemical world-soul, the anima mundi, that sleeps in matter, is made responsible for the origin of a new star, and is said to have its seat – that is, its special concentration – in the sun. But it can be seen clearly that the anima mundi is no more than a kind of relic in Kepler’s mind and plays a subordinate role compared to the individual souls of the various heavenly bodies.

### Section 3 [p. 163]
>Kepler in Harmonices mundi, book IV (Frisch, V, p. 224):
>
>>“ All ideas or formal concepts of the harmonies, as I have just discussed them, lie in those beings that possess the faculty of rational cognition, and they are not at all received within by discursive reasoning; rather they are derived from a natural instinct and are inborn in those beings as the number (an intellectual thing) of petals in a flower or the number of seed cells in a fruit is innate in the forms of the plants.”

### Section 4 [p. 169]
>Kepler in Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, pp. 6-7:
>
>>“Therefore the bodies themselves which, as such, are confined by the limits of their surfaces and are thus unable to expand into spherical form, are endowed with various powers, nesting in the bodies, which are somewhat freer than the bodies themselves, possessing no corporeal matter but consisting of a particular matter of their own that assumes geometrical dimensions, and which powers flow out from them and aspire to the circular form – as can be clearly seen, especially, in the magnet but also in many other things. Is it any wonder, then, if that principle of all beauty in the world, which the divine Moses introduces into scarcely created matter, even on the first day of creation, as (so to speak) the Creator’s instrument, by which to give visible shape and life to all things – is it any wonder, I say, if this primary principle and this most beautiful being in the whole corporeal world, the matrix of all animal faculties, and the bond between the physical and the intellectual world, submitted to those very laws by which the world was to be formed? Hence the sun is a certain body in which [resides] that faculty of communication itself to all things which we call light. For this reason alone its rightful place is the middle point and centre of the whole world, so that it may diffuse itself perpetually and uniformly throughout the universe. All other beings that share in light imitate the sun.”
>
>In view of Kepler’s conflict with Fludd, the representative of traditional alchemy, a conflict which we shall discuss later, it is important that Kepler’s symbol – of a type designated by C. G. Jung as a mandala because of its spherical form – contains no hint of the number four or quaternity. This is all the more significant since Kepler had an excellent knowledge of the Pythagorean numerical speculations, particularly of the tetraktys, which he discusses in detail in the third book of his Harmonices mundi as an historical introduction to his own theory of musical intervals. But these ancient speculations are to Kepler a mere curiosity; for him the number four has no symbolical character. Perhaps the lack of a symbolism of time in Kepler’s spherical picture is related to the lack of any suggestion of quaternity. Movement in a straight line, directed away from the centre, is the only kind contained in Kepler’s symbol, and in so far as this movement is caught up by the outer surface of the sphere the symbol can be termed static. Since the Trinity had never been represented in this particular way before Kepler, and since the stands at the threshold of the scientific age, one is tempted to assume that Kepler’s “mandala” symbolizes a way of thinking or psychological attitude which, far transcending Kepler’s person in significance, produced that nature science which we today call classical. From within an inner centre the psyche seems to move outward, in the sense of an extraversion, into the physical world in which, by definition, everything that occurs is automatic; so that the mind, itself in a state of rest, embraces this physical world, as it were, with its ideas.
>
>According to the psychology of Jung the psychological processes that accompany an enlargement of consciousness can be represented as the coming into being of a new centre embracing conscious as well as unconscious contents (called “self by Jung). These “centring” processes are always characterized by the symbolical pictures of the mandala and of rotating movement. In Chinese texts the latter is very vividly termed “circulation of light.”
>
>In an attempt to apply these results of analytical psychology to the phase of intellectual history known as the rise of classical mechanics in the seventeenth century (which is most closely connected with the heliocentric idea), we should bear in mind that the attention of the scientists who helped to found classical mechanics was directed only outward. It is therefore to be expected that the above mentioned inner centring processes, together with the appropriate images, would be projected outward. Indeed we can observe, in Kepler’s views specifically, that the planetary system with the sun as centre became the bearer of the mandala-picture, the earth being related to the sun as in the ego to the more embracing “self.” It appears that in this way the heliocentric theory received, in the minds of its adherents, an injection of strongly emotional content stemming from the unconscious. Perhaps the projection of the above mentioned symbolical image of the inner rotating movement onto the external rotation of the heavenly bodies contributed to the investment of this external rotation with an absolute validity that went beyond empirical experience. An additional argument for this opinion is that in Newton the ideas of absolute space and absolute time entered even into his theological views.

### Section 5 [p. 180]
>According to Kepler, the individual soul, which he calls vis formatrix or matrix formativa, possesses the fundamental ability to react with the help of our instinctus to certain harmonious proportions which correspond to specific rational divisions of the circle. In music this intellectual power reveals itself in the perception of euphony (consonance) in certain musical intervals, an effect that Kepler thus does not explain in a purely mechanical way. Now the soul is said to have a similar specific reactability to the harmonious proportions of the angles which the rays of stellar light, striking the earth, form with each other. It is with these, in Kepler’s opinion, that astrology should concern itself. According to him, then, the stars exert no special remote influence, since their true distances are of no importance to astrology and only their light rays can be regarded as effective. The soul knows about the harmonious proportions through the instinctus without conscious reflection (sine ratiocination) because the soul, by virtue of its circular form, is an image of God in Whom these proportions and the geometric truths following therefrom exist from all eternity. Now since the soul, in consequence of its circular form, has knowledge of these, it is impressed by the external forms of the configurations of rays and retains a memory of them from its very birth. I cite Kepler’s words on this:
>
>>“I speak here as do the astrologers. If I should express my own opinion it would be that there is no evil star in the heavens, and this, among others, chiefly for the following reasons: it is the nature of man as such, dwelling as it does here on earth, that lends to the planetary radiations their effect on itself; just as the sense of hearing, endowed with the faculty of discerning chords, lends to music uch power that it incites him who hears it to dance.” […]
>
>The soul, according to Kepler, contains the idea of the zodiac within itself by virtue of its inherent circular form; but it is the planets, and not the fixed stars, which (through the intermediary of light) are the effective vehicles of astrological influence. The “distribution of the twelve signs among the seven planets” is for him a fable; yet the doctrina directionum, he thinks, is based on good reason since it emphasizes the harmonious combination of two rays of light that is called an “aspect.” […]
>
>The human soul, in Kepler’s view, flows at birth into a pre-existent form, which is shaped on the earth by these rays of light from the stars (planets).
>
>Cf. the Tertius interveniens:
>
>>“For it is by no means to be pronounced foolishness that man is naturali necessitate diversified and qualified in accordance with the Configurationibus stellarum; this might really far rather be called an “influence” of the nature of man into the star (as of fluid plaster into a mould) than, on the contrary, an “influence” of the star into man.” […]
>
>Kepler in Harmonices mundi, book IV (Frisch, V, p. 238):
>
>>“The same thing can be proved from the inner properties of the soul, already touched upon in Chapter 3. For, since it is from the soul that the harmonies of the configurations obtain their formal being (esse formale), the soul certainly possesses an intimate knowledge of the figures, both circumferential and central; [this knowledge it possesses] by virtue of the same distinction by which the soul is both a circle and a point, that is, the centre of a circle. But although every soul bears within itself a certain idea of the circle – a circle not merely detached from matter but also somehow from magnitude (as has been said in Chapter 3), so that in this case circle and centre almost coincide and the soul itself can be called a potential circle as well as a point differentiated according to directions and thus somehow qualified – nevertheless there must be observed the distinction that some faculties of the soul have to be considered rather as circle, others as point. For as one cannot imagine a circle without a centre and, conversely, the point has about it an area circumscribable y a circular line, so there is no activity in the soul without an impression upon the imagination. Conversely, all internal reception or meditation is caused by external movement, every inward function of the soul by outward movements. The principal and highest faculty of the soul, which is called mind, what is it if not the centre? The ratiocinative faculty, what is it if not the circle? For as the centre is within and the circle without, so the mind [mens] remains within itself, whereas ratiocination weaves a sort of outer covering; and as the centre is the basis, source, and origin of the circle, so it the mind of ratiocination.
>>
>>On the other hand, all these faculties of the soul – the mind, the faculty of ratiocination, and even the sensitive faculty – are a sort of centre whereas the motor function of the soul are the periphery; for again, as the outer circle is drawn around the centre, so is action directed outward whereas cognition and meditation are performed inwardly; and as the circle is related to the point so is outward action to inner contemplation, and animal movement to sensory perception. The point, namely, because it is everywhere opposite to the circumference, is by its very nature suited to represent the passively receptive; and the sensitive soul – that which is perceptive of the rays of the planets – what else does it do in sensing and perceiving than be passive, that is to say, be moved by that which is opposite to it? Now compare the above two comparisons with each other: as the central point is the same in both cases, so also is the form of cognition somehow the same, the chief, mental [form of cognition] and the sensory one or rather its analogue which perceives the radiation. None of these [cognitive functions] makes, as such, use of discursive ratiocination but has knowledge without it. Thus this – I mean, sublunary nature and also the sensitive nature [in man] – is a slight image of that, to wit, the principal [faculty], the human mind: just so is that logical reasoning an image of these action or operations of the soul, and either is a circle.
>>
>>In so far, then, as the souls are perceptive of the celestial radiations and are thus moved by them, as it were, with an inward, self-contained movement, we must regard them as points; but in so far as they in turn cause movement, that is to say, transfer the harmonies of the radiations which they have perceived into their operations and are stimulated to action by them, they ought to be considered as circles. It follows that, in so far as the soul takes cognizance of the harmonies of the rays, it must chiefly concern itself with the central figure; but in so far as it acts, provoking meteoric phenomena (or what corresponds to these in human beings) it must devote itself to the circumferential figure. In an aspect, however, the effectiveness is of greater interest to us than the manner in which the aspect may be perceived by the operating soul; therefore the consideration of the circumferential figure is more important to us than that of the central figure.


### Section 6 [p. 205]
>From what has been said above the reader has gained, we hope, some understanding of the prevailing atmosphere of the first half of the seventeenth century when the then new, quantitative, scientifically mathematical way of thinking collided with the alchemical tradition expressed in qualitative, symbolical pictures: the former represented by the productive, creative Kepler always struggling for new modes of expression, the latter by the epigone Fludd who could not help but feel clearly the threat to his world of mysteries, already become archaic, from the new alliance of empirical induction with mathematically logical thought. One has the impression that Fludd was always in the wrong when he let himself be drawn into a discussion concerning astronomy or physics. As a consequence of his rejection of the quantitative element he perforce remained unconscious of its laws and inevitably came into irreconcilable conflict with scientific thinking.
>
>Fludd’s attitude, however, seems to us somewhat easier to understand when it is viewed in the perspective of a more general differentiation between two types of mind, a differentiation that can be traced throughout history, the one type considering the quantitative relations of the parts to be essential, the other the qualitative indivisibility of the whole. We already find this contrast, for example, in antiquity in the two corresponding definitions of beauty: in the one it is the proper agreement of the arts with each other and with the whole, in the other (going back to Plotinus) there is no reference to parts but beauty is the eternal radiance of the “One” shining through the material phenomenon. An analogous contrast can also be found later in the well-known quarrel between Goethe and Newton concerning the theory of colours: Goethe had a similar aversion to “parts” and always emphasize the disturbing influence of instruments on the “natural” phenomena. We should like to advocate the point of view that these controversial attitudes are really illustrations of the psychological contrast between feeling type or intuitive type and thinking type. Goethe and Fludd represent the feeling type and the intuitive approach, Newton and Kepler the thinking type; even Plotinus should probably not be called a systematic thinker, in contrast to Aristotle and Plato.
>
>Just because the modern scholar prefers in principle not to ascribe to either one of these two opposite types a higher degree of consciousness than to the other, the old historical dispute between Kepler and Fludd may still be considered interesting as a matter of principle even in an age for which both Fludd’s and Kepler’s scientific ideas about world music have lost all significance. An added indication of this can be seen in particular in the fact that the “quaternary” attitude of Fludd corresponds, in contrast to Kepler’s “trinitarian" attitude, from a psychological point of view, to a greater completeness of experience. Whereas Kepler conceives of the soul almost as a mathematically describable system of resonators, it has always been the symbolical image that has tried to express, in addition, the immeasurable side of experience which also includes the imponderables of the emotions and emotional evaluations. Even though at the cost of consciousness of the quantitative side of nature and its laws, Fludd’s “hieroglyphic” figures do try to preserve a unity of the inner experience of the “observer” (as we should say today) and the external processes of nature, and thus a wholeness in its contemplation – a wholeness formerly contained in the idea of the analogy between microcosm and macrocosm but apparently already lacking in Kepler and lost in the world view of classical natural science.
>
>Modern quantum physics again stresses the factor of the disturbance of phenomena through measurement (see the following section), and modern psychology again utilizes symbolical images as raw material (especially those that have originated spontaneously in dreams and fantasies) in order to recognize processes in the collective (“objective”) psyche. Thus physics and psychology reflect again for modern man the old contrast between the quantitative and the qualitative. Since the time of Kepler and Fludd, however, the possibility of bridging these antithetical poles has become less remote. On the one hand, the idea of complementarity in modern physics has demonstrated to us, in a new kind of synthesis, that the contradiction in the applications of old contrasting conceptions (such as particle and wave) is only apparent; on the other hand, the employability of old alchemical ideas in the psychology of Jung points to a deeper unity of psychical and physical occurrences. To us, unlike Kepler and Fludd, the only acceptable point of view appears to be the one that recognizes both sides of reality – the quantitative and the qualitative, the physical and the psychical – as compatible with each other, and can embrace them simultaneously.

### Section 7 [p. 208]
>It is obviously out of the question for modern man to revert to the archaistic point of view that paid the price of its unity and completeness by a naïve ignorance of nature. His strong desire for a greater unification of his world view, however, impels him to recognize the significance of the pre-scientific stage of knowledge for the development of scientific ideas – a significance of which mention has already been made at the beginning of his essay – by supplementing the investigation of this knowledge, directed inward. The former process is devoted to adjusting our knowledge to external objects; the latter should bring to light the archetypal images used in the creation of our scientific concepts. Only by combining both these directions of research may complete understanding be obtained.
>
>Among scientists in particular, the universal desire for a greater unification of our world view is greatly intensified by the fact that, though we now have natural sciences, we no longer have a total scientific picture of the world. Since the discovery of the quantum of action, physics has gradually been forced to relinquish its proud claim to be able to understand, in principle, the whole world. This very circumstance, however, as a correction of earlier one-sidedness, could contain the germ of progress toward a unified conception of the entire cosmos of which the natural sciences are only a part.
>
>I shall try to demonstrate this by reference to the still unsolved problem of the relationship between occurrences in the physical world and those in the soul, a problem that had already engaged Kepler’s attention. After he had shown that the optical images on the retina are inverted in relation to the original objects he baffled the scientific world for a while by asking why then people did not see objects upside down instead of upright. It was of course easy to recognize this question as only an illusory problem, since man is in fact never able to compare images with real objects but only registers the sensory impressions that result from the stimulation of certain areas of the retina. The general problem of the relation between psyche and physis, between the inner and the outer, can, however, hardly be said to have been solved by the concept of “psychophysical parallelism” which was advanced in the last century. Yet modern science may have brought us closer to a more satisfying conception of this relationship by setting up, within the field of physics, the concept of complementarity. It would be most satisfactory of all if physis and psyche could be seen as complementary aspects of the same reality. We do not yet know, however, whether or not we are here confronted – as surmised by Bohr and other scientists – with a true complementary relation, involving mutual exclusion, in the sense that an exact observation of the physiological processes would result in such an interference with the psychical processes that the latter would become downright inaccessible to observation. It is, however, certain that modern physics has generalized the old confrontation of the apprehending subject with the apprehended object into the idea of a cleavage or division that exists between the observer or the means of observation, on the one hand, and the system observed, on the other. While the existence of such a division is a necessary condition of human cognition, modern physics holds that its placement is, to a certain extent, arbitrary and results from a choice co-determined by considerations of expediency and hence partially free. Furthermore, whereas older philosophical systems have located the psychical on the subjective side of the division, that is, on the side of the apprehending subject, and the material on the other side – the side of that which is objectively observed – the modern point of view is more liberal in this respect: microphysics shows that the means of observation can also consist of apparatuses that register automatically; modern psychology proves that there is on the side of that which is observed introspectively an unconscious psyche of considerable objective reality. Thereby the presumed objective order of nature is, on the one hand, relativized with respect to the no less indispensable means of observation outside the observed system; and, on the other, placed beyond the distinction of “physical” and “psychical.”
>
>Now, there is a basic difference between the observers, or instruments of observation, which must be taken into consideration by modern microphysics, and the detached observer of classical physics. By the latter I mean one who is not necessarily without effect on the system observed but whose influence can always be eliminated by determinable corrections. In microphysics, however, the natural laws are of such a kind that every bit of knowledge gained from a measurement must be paid for by the loss of other, complementary items of knowledge. Every observation, therefore, interferes on an indeterminable scale both with the instruments of observation and with the system observed and interrupts the causal connection of the phenomena preceding it with those following it. This uncontrollable interaction between observer and system observed, taking place in every process of measurement, invalidates the deterministic conception of the phenomena assumed in classical physics: the series of events taking place according to pre-determined rules is interrupted, after a free choice has been made by the beholder between mutually exclusive experimental arrangements, by the selective observation which, as an essentially non-automatic occurrence, may be compared to a creation in the microcosm or even to a transmutation the results of which are, however, unpredictable and beyond human control.
>
>In this way the role of the observer in modern physics is satisfactorily accounted for. The reaction of the knowledge gained on the gainer of that knowledge gives rise, however, to a situation transcending natural science, since it is necessary for the sake of the completeness of the experience connected therewith that it should have an obligatory force for the researcher. We have seen how not only alchemy but the heliocentric idea furnishes an instructive example of the problem as to how the process of knowing is connected with the religious experience of transmutation undergone by him who acquires knowledge. This connection can only be comprehended through symbols which both imaginatively express the emotional aspect of the experience and stand in vital relationship to the sum total of contemporary knowledge and the actual process of cognition. Just because in our times the possibility of such symbolism has become an alien idea, it may be considered especially interesting to examine another age to which the concepts of what is now called classical scientific mechanics where foreign but which permits us to prove the existence of a symbol that had, simultaneously, a religious and a scientific function. The new type of statistical, quantum-physical natural law, which functions as an intermediary between discontinuum and continuum, cannot in principle be reduced to causal-deterministic laws in the sense of classical physics; and just in limiting that which happens according to law to that which is reproducible it must recognize the existence of the essentially unique in physical occurrences. I should like to propose, following Bohr, the designation “statistical correspondence” for this new form of natural law.
