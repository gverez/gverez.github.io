### Introduction [p. 141]
>I (L.V.) have a vivid memory of an excursion the day after the conference in South Carolina honoring 30 years of the Aharonov-Bohm effect when I, David and Saral Bohm were riding in a carriage in the old streets of Charleston. I remember discussing with David my passion for the many-worlds interpretation (Everett 1957), and then, what I find most attractive in the Bohm theory: that it is unambiguous, deterministic and complete. I see it as the best candidate for the final theory of the world for a physicist (such as Y.A.) who does not want to accept the existence of many worlds. David said to me that what I liked in his theory did not have much value for him. He had a strong belief that a man cannot find the final theory of the world. All that we can do is to look for a better and better approximation to the correct theory which is intrinsically unattainable to us. His vision was that the causal interpretation should suggest a way for generalization to the next-level theory which also, by no means, will be the final theory of the world.
