## Tension in Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics <a name="arkhe"></a>
*With Millard Baublitz, Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Introduction [p. 251]

>David Bohm and his predecessor Louis de Broglie (1927) were exploratory men, each of whom proposed and examined a number of theories. Their various theories shared some central ideas but also differed in significant respects, and an assessment of all of these variant theories is beyond the scope of this paper. We shall mainly restrict our attention to what we shall call “Bohm's initial theory,” which was presented in his pioneering papers (Bohm 1952), and in two letters (Bohm 1952; 1953) and a paper (Bohm 1953) which clarified and defended his initial presentation. Our main thesis is that two different physical views coexist uneasily in Bohm's initial theory, which we shall call “the causal view” and “the guidance view.” We shall cite passages indicating that he was aware of this fact and that he pondered ways of relieving the tension between the two views. Because of the great historical importance of Bohm's initial theory, there is obviously value in a careful explication de texte. In addition, however, we have a conceptual thesis: that what makes Bohm's initial theory attractive philosophically and scientifically is a conjunction of some features of the causal view and some of the guidance view. We shall present some reasons for skepticism about the prospects for a coherent combination of the two views. We shall also note that some of the most influential advocates of Bohmian mechanics – including Dürr et al. (1992), Valentini (1991), and Cushing (1994) – treat the tension between the two views in the initial theory of Bohm by surgery, for they retain the guidance view and discard whatever of the causal view is incompatible with it. We shall not undertake to assess these recent expositions of Bohmian mechanics, because of mathematical difficulties which we find very formidable, but we shall express some skeptical doubts in hope of evoking clarifications and amplifications from the authors.

### Bohm’s initial theory [p. 251]

>Section 4 of Bohm's paper (Bohm 1952), entitled “New Physical Interpretation of Schrödinger's Equation,” restricts its attention to a single particle, but there is a straightforward generalization to many-particle systems in a later section. Since the presentation in the initial paper (Bohm 1952) is somewhat diffuse, we shall quote from a compact summary, which for simplicity concerns only a single particle, given in a later paper (Bohm 1953).

>Passage 1.

>>“… the author has proposed a causal reinterpretation of the quantum theory, based on the following hypotheses:
>>
>>(a) a quantum-mechanical system, such as an electron, consists basically of a particle having a precisely defined position, which varies continuously as a function of the time.
>>
>>(b) this particle is acted on not only by the classical potential but also by an additional quantum-potential, which is important at the atomic level but negligible at the macroscopic level. […]
>
>>To obtain the same predictions for all experimental results as are obtained from the usual interpretation of the quantum theory it is necessary, however, to make the following additional special assumptions…: (1) the wave function field satisfies Schrödinger’s equation. (2) The particle velocity is restricted […] (3) We do not predict or control the precise location of a particle, but have a statistical ensemble of particles with a probability density.” (Bohm 1953). […]
>
>Furthermore, a comment was added to (3): “The use of statistics is, however, not inherent in the conceptual structure, but merely a consequence of our ignorance of the precise initial conditions of the particle.” […]
>
>The one important point that we have omitted so far in our summary of Bohm's initial theory is his insistence upon the physical reality of the wave function.

>Passage IV:
>
>>Since the force on a particle now depends on a function of the absolute value of the wave function evaluated at the actual location of the particle, we have effectively been led to regard the wave function of an individual electron as a mathematical representation of an objectively real field. This field exerts a force on the particle in a way that is analogous to, but not identical with, the way in which an electromagnetic field exerts a force on a charge, and a meson field exerts a force on a nucleon. In the last analysis, there is, of course, no reason why a particle should not be acted on by a wave-function-field, as well as by an electromagnetic field, a gravitational field, a set of meson fields, and perhaps by still other fields that have not yet been discovered. (Bohm 1952)

### Tension between the causal and guidance views [p. 257]

>Before we proceed to Section 4 to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the causal and guidance views, it may be useful to the reader to answer the question: who among the avowed followers of Bohm are the advocates of the causal view and who of the guidance view? Unequivocally there are advocates of the guidance view, notably Bell (1987), Dürr, Goldstein and Zanghi (DGZ) (1992), Valentini (1991) and Cushing (1994). They extract from Bohm's initial theory only the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the attribution of a definite position to a particle at every time, and the guidance equation. The conjunction of these three principles is called “Bohmian mechanics” by DGZ, and their terminology is widely followed. They do not include the Born rule as one of the assumptions of Bohmian mechanics because they claim to be able to derive it mathematically from their austere set of principles. They dispense with Bohm's hypotheses (b) and (c), because “For them, the quantum potential appears as an artificial means to cast this essentially non-classical mechanics into a superficially Newtonian form” (Cushing 1994 – said of DGZ, but with apparent intention of application to Valentini and himself). To our knowledge, there is no follower of Bohm who advocates the causal view in its purity. This fact does not imply, however, that the causal view is uninteresting, because it is an ingredient in the overall theory of Bohm and Hiley (1993), Dewdney et al. (1987), Holland (1993), Kyprianidis (1988), and perhaps others. The endurance of the causal view in the thought of these Bohmians might be explained by the historical contingency of Bohm's heuristics in his initial theory. But we feel that there is another reason, going beyond historical contingency – viz., the conceptual strengths and attractions of the causal view.

### Strengths and weaknesses of the causal and guidance views [p. 257]

>The greatest strength of the causal view is that it subsumes quantum mechanics under classical mechanics, once the innovation of the quantum potential is accepted. Since classical mechanics is an “intuitive” and “intelligible” framework – in part because of its inherent qualities and in part because of its internalization by post-Newtonian physicists – much of the mystery of quantum mechanics is thereby exorcised. The indefiniteness of physical quantities, which the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics requires us to accept, is removed by this subsumption under classical mechanics, since a definite position and a definite velocity are attributed to each particle at every time. The causal view clarifies the status of the wave function by making it objective and physically real, an entity which acts upon particles by a force law formulated in the quantum mechanical potential, analogous to the way the electromagnetic field acts upon a particle by the Lorentz force law. The “guidance” of a particle by the wave function is, in principle, no more mysterious than the guidance of a charged particle by the electric and magnetic fields. In both cases there is no direct determination of the velocity of the particle by the force, but rather a determination of an acceleration.
>
>The greatest weakness of the causal view is its difficulty in recovering the Born rule. […]
>
>Bohm's theory is supposed to remove the mystery from the reduction of the wave packet by ascribing definite values to the position variable x of the particle and the position variable y of the apparatus. But in the causal view what guarantees that the correlation postulated by standard quantum mechanics is recovered? The quantum-mechanical potential does indeed impart cor- related impulses to the particle and to the pointer needle of the apparatus, but if a range of initial velocities is allowed by both particle and apparatus, the correlation between x and y needed to obtain agreement with quantum mechanics may not be obtained. It is relevant to remark at this juncture that in both the causal and guidance views, the positions of the particles do not affect the temporal evolution of the wave function. There is a causal asymmetry, in that the wave affects the particles, but the particles are causally irrelevant to the wave. This asymmetry is troublesome (Anandan and Brown 1995), but we shall not base our skepticism upon it. Rather, we shall tentatively accept the fact that correlations established by the quantum-mechanical potential can be a surrogate for the causal efficacy of the particles. […]
>
>In sum, the quantum-mechanical account of the measuring process is mysterious but robust, while the causal view offers a theory of measurement that is not mysterious but also not robust. […]
>
>We turn now to the guidance view, and we find that its strengths and weaknesses are complementary to the strengths and weaknesses of the causal version. The greatest strength of the guidance view is agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics, once the Born relation is given at an initial time. The reason is that the guidance condition guarantees the equation of continuity, and hence the validity of the Born relation at one time ensures its validity at all times. Once the guidance condition is granted, the correlation between particles governed by a quantum-mechanical entangled state is no longer disrupted by the contingencies of initial velocities of those particles – because the guidance condition eliminates these contingencies and fixes the velocities for all time. The guidance view indeed requires that we accept the counterintuitive conclusion that the electron is at rest when the wave function is a quantum mechanical s-state, but at least this counterintuitive proposition guarantees stability of atoms and prevents the automatic ionization that the causal view entailed. The weakness of the guidance view is that it abandons the intuitive framework of Newtonian mechanics. The wave function is indeed a kind of force field in the guidance view, but it exerts a force on the particle not by providing a quantum mechanical potential to supplement the ordinary potential, but rather by directly influencing the velocity through the guidance condition. It is an Aristotelian doctrine, rejected by the classical mechanics of the seventeenth century, that there is a direct connection between force and velocity. The guidance view, in postulating a direct relation between the guiding field and velocity, is thus philosophically closer to pre-Newtonian than to post-Newtonian mechanics.
>
>We have deferred the discussion of one important weakness. In listing the strengths of the guidance view we tentatively accepted the validity of Born's relation between the probability density in configuration space and the absolute square of the wave function at an initial time. But is there a promising justification of Born's relation within the guidance view? A concrete example provides ground for skepticism.

### Can the causal and guidance views be combined? [p. 262]

>Speculations about the new force led Bohm to further speculations (Bohm 1952) about a level of very short distances where the linear Schrödinger equation breaks down and must be replaced by a nonlinear equation. These speculations are beyond the scope of the present paper. We feel justified, however, in asserting that Bohm's proposal in his 1952 papers for combining the causal and guidance views of his mechanics led him beyond the simple principles of his initial theory which constitute much of its attraction.
>
>Kyprianidis (1988) has a mathematically ingenious proposal for reconciling the causal view and the guidance view of Bohmian mechanics. […]
>
>It is evident from this passage that Kyprianidis does not expect to achieve a combination of the causal and guidance views within the range of Bohm's simple initial formulation. Instead, he looks ahead to the ideas of sub-quantum fluctuations, as proposed by Bohm and Vigier (1954) and later works of Vigier and his school. This program is beyond the scope of the present paper.

### Conclusion [p. 263]

>According to Bell, “the de Broglie-Bohm version of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is... experimentally equivalent to the usual version insofar as the latter is unambiguous. But it does not require, in its very formulation, a vague division of the world into ‘system’ and ‘apparatus’... Indeed the de Broglie-Bohm theory is sharp where the usual one is fuzzy, and general where the usual one is special” (Bell 1987). Bell's endorsement is very strong. Other writers (e.g., Cushing 1994) have maintained that only historical circumstances have made Bohmian mechanics heterodox, since it has all the virtues of the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics and some other virtues besides.
>
>Our main conclusion is a dissent from these endorsements. We question the claim that resistance to Bohmian mechanics is irrational, due primarily to authority and indoctrination. What we have found is that there are two distinct views implicit in Bohm's initial theory, the causal and the guidance, and each has some virtues and some weaknesses. We are dubious that a simple choice of one version will suffice, as maintained by Dürr et al. (1992), who reject the causal version in favor of the guidance view. If the two versions could be consistently combined so as to preserve the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of each singly, then the strong praise accorded by Bell, Cushing, and others would be well deserved. But we have no idea how this combination can be achieved without drastic elaborations of Bohm's initial theory. It is the intention of one of us (Baublitz 1996) to study the subquantum fluctuation theory of Bohm and Vigier (1954); judgment on the prospects of the elaborated formulations of Bohmian mechanics will be postponed at least until this study.

>We wish to add that we are adherents neither of the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics nor of the view that the quantum formalism needs no modification. In our opinion, the quantum-mechanical measurement problem cannot be solved without a modification of the formalism itself, perhaps by a stochastic modification of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, perhaps by an even more radical modification. We doubt, however, that the solution to the measurement problem and to other conceptual difficulties of quantum mechanics has already been achieved by Bohm and his followers.
