## “Relative state” formulation of quantum mechanics <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Reviews of modern physics, vol. 29, 1957*

### Realm of applicability of the conventional or “external observation” formulation of quantum mechanics [p. 2]

>We take the conventional or “external observation” formulation of quantum mechanics to be essentially the following: A physical system is completely described by a state function Ψ, which is an element of a Hilbert space, and which furthermore gives information only to the extent of specifying the probabilities of the results of various observations which can be made on the system by external observers. There are two fundamentally different ways in which the state function can change:
>
>Process 1: The discontinuous change brought about by the observation of a quantity with eigenstates in which the state Ψ will be changed to a single state with a given probability.
>
>Process 2: The continuous, deterministic change of state of an isolated system with time according to a wave equation.
>
>This formulation describes a wealth of experience. No experimental evidence is known which contradicts it.
>
>Not all conceivable situations fit the framework of this mathematical formulation. Consider for example an isolated system consisting of an observer or measuring apparatus, plus an object system. Can the change with time of the state of the total system be described by Process 2? If so, then it would appear that no discontinuous probabilistic process like Process 1 can take place. If not, we are forced to admit that systems which contain observers are not subject to the same kind of quantum-mechanical description as we admit for all other physical systems. The question cannot be ruled out as lying in the domain of psychology. Much of the discussion of “observers” in quantum mechanics has to do with photoelectric cells, photographic plates, and similar devices where a mechanistic attitude can hardly be contested. For the following one can limit himself to this class of problems, if he is unwilling to consider observers in the more familiar sense on the same mechanistic level of analysis. […]

>How is one to apply the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics to the space-time geometry itself? The issue becomes especially acute in the case of a closed universe. There is no place to stand outside the system to observe it. There is nothing outside it to produce transitions from one state to another. Even the familiar concept of a proper state of the energy is completely inapplicable. In the derivation of the law of conservation of energy, one defines the total energy by way of an integral extended over a surface large enough to include all parts of the system and their interactions. But in a closed space, when a surface is made to include more and more of the volume, it ultimately disappears into nothingness. Attempts to define the total energy for a closed space collapse to the vacuous statement, zero equals zero.
>
>How are a quantum description of a closed universe, of approximate measurements, and of a system that contains an observer to be made? These three questions have one feature in common, that they all inquire about the quantum mechanics that is internal to an isolated system.
>
>No way is evident to apply the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics to a system that is not subject to external observation. The whole interpretive scheme of that formalism rests upon the notion of external observation. The probabilities of the various possible outcomes of the observation are prescribed exclusively by Process 1. Without that part of the formalism there is no means whatever to ascribe a physical interpretation to the conventional machinery. But Process 1 is out of the question for systems not subject to external observation.

### Quantum mechanics internal to an isolated system [p. 4]

>This paper proposes to regard pure wave mechanics (Process 2 only) as a complete theory. It postulates that a wave function that obeys a linear wave equation everywhere and at all times supplies a complete mathematical model for every isolated physical system without exception. It further postulates that every system that is subject to external observation can be regarded as part of a larger isolated system.
>
>The wave function is taken as the basic physical entity with no a priori interpretation. Interpretation only comes after an investigation of the logical structure of the theory. Here as always the theory itself sets the framework for its interpretation.

### Concept of relative state [p. 7]

>This is an important representation used frequently.
>
>Summarizing: There does not, in general, exist anything like a single state for one subsystem of a composite system. Subsystems do not possess states that are independent of the states of the remainder of the system, so that the subsystem states are generally correlated with one another. One can arbitrarily choose a state for one subsystem, and be led to the relative state for the remainder. Thus we are faced with a fundamental relativity of states, which is implied by the formalism of composite systems. It is meaningless to ask the absolute state of a subsystem – one can only ask the state relative to a given state of the remainder of the subsystem. […]
>
>The discontinuous “jump” into an eigenstate is thus only a relative proposition, dependent upon the mode of decomposition of the total wave function into the superposition, and relative to a particularly chosen apparatus-coordinate value. So far as the complete theory is concerned all elements of the superposition exist simultaneously, and the entire process is quite continuous.
>
>von Neumann’s example is only a special case of a more general situation. Consider any measuring apparatus interacting with any object system. As a result of the interaction the state of the measuring apparatus is no longer capable of independent definition. It can be defined only relative to the state of the object system. In other words, there exists only a correlation between the two states of the two systems. It seems as if nothing can ever be settled by such a measurement.
>
>This indefinite behavior seems to be quite at variance with our observations, since physical objects always appear to us to have definite positions. Can we reconcile this feature wave mechanical theory built purely on Process 2 with experience, or must the theory be abandoned as untenable? In order to answer this question we consider the problem of observation itself within the framework of the theory.

### Observation [p. 9]

>We have the task of making deductions about the appearance of phenomena to observers which are considered as purely physical systems and are treated within the theory. To accomplish this it is necessary to identify some present properties of such an observer with features of the past experience of the observer. Thus, in order to say that an observer 0 has observed the event α, it is necessary that the state of 0 has become changed from its former state to a new state which is dependent upon α.
>
>It will suffice for our purposes to consider the observers to possess memories (i.e., parts of a relatively permanent nature whose states are in correspondence with past experience of the observers). In order to make deductions about the past experience of an observer it is sufficient to deduce the present contents of the memory as it appears within the mathematical model.
>
>As models for observers we can, if we wish, consider automatically functioning machines, possessing sensory apparatus and coupled to recording devices capable of registering past sensory data and machine configurations. We can further suppose that the machine is so constructed that its present actions shall be determined not only by its present sensory data, but by the contents of its memory as well. Such a machine will then be capable of performing a sequence of observations (measurements), and furthermore of deciding upon its future experiments on the basis of past results. If we consider that current sensory data, as well as machine configuration, is immediately recorded in the memory, then the actions of the machine at a given instant can be regarded as a function of the memory contents only, and all relevant experience of the machine is contained in the memory.
>
>For such machines we are justified in using such phrases as “the machine has perceived A” or “the machine is aware of A” if the occurrence of A is represented in the memory, since the future behavior of the machine will be based upon the occurrence of A. In fact, all of the customary language of subjective experience is quite applicable to such machines, and forms the most natural and useful mode of expression when dealing with their behavior, as is well known to individuals who work with complex automata. […]
>
>A typical element of the final superposition describes a state of affairs wherein the observer has perceived an apparently random sequence of definite results for the observations. Furthermore the object systems have been left in the corresponding eigenstates of the observation. At this stage suppose that a redetermination of an earlier system observation takes place. Then it follows that every element of the resulting final superposition will describe the observer with a memory configuration of the form […] in which the earlier memory coincides with the later – i.e., the memory states are correlated. It will thus appear to the observer, as described by a typical element of the superposition, that each initial observation on a system caused the system to “jump” into an eigenstate in a random fashion and thereafter remain there for subsequent measurements on the same system. Therefore –disregarding for the moment quantitative questions of relative frequencies – the probabilistic assertions of Process 1 appear to be valid to the observer described by a typical element of the final superposition.
>
>We thus arrive at the following picture: Throughout all of a sequence of observation processes there is only one physical system representing the observer, yet there is no single unique state of the observer (which follows from the representations of interacting systems). Nevertheless, there is a representation in terms of a superposition, each element of which contains a definite observer state and a corresponding system state. Thus with each succeeding observation (or interaction), the observer state “branches” into a number of different states. Each branch represents a different outcome of the measurement and the corresponding eigenstate for the object-system state. All branches exist simultaneously in the superposition after any given sequence of observations.
>
>>
>> **Note added in proof**. - In reply to a preprint of this article some correspondents have raised the question of the “transition from possible to actual,” arguing that in “reality” there is – as our experience testifies – no such splitting of observer states, so that only one branch can ever actually exist. Since this point may occur to other readers the following is offered in explanation.
>>
>>The whole issue of the transition from “possible” to “actual” is taken care of in the theory in a very simple way – there is no such transition, nor is such a transition necessary for the theory to be in accord with our experience. From the viewpoint of the theory all elements of a superposition (all “branches”) are “actual,” none any more “real” than the rest. It is unnecessary to suppose that all but one are somehow destroyed, since all the separate elements of a superposition individually obey the wave equation with complete indifference to the presence or absence (“actuality” or not) of any other elements. This total lack of effect of one branch on another also implies that no observer will ever be aware of any “splitting” process.
>>
>>Arguments that the world picture presented by this theory is contradicted by experience, because we are unaware of any branching process, are like the criticism of the Copernican theory that the mobility of the earth as a real physical fact is incompatible with the common sense interpretation of nature because we feel no such motion. In both cases the argument fails when it is shown that the theory itself predicts that our experience will be what it in fact is. (In the Copernican case the addition of Newtonian physics was required to be able to show that the earth’s inhabitants would be unaware of any motion of the earth.)
>
>The “trajectory” of the memory configuration of an observer performing a sequence of measurements is thus not a linear sequence of memory configurations, but a branching tree, with all possible outcomes existing simultaneously in a final superposition with various coefficients in the mathematical model. In any familiar memory device the branching does not continue indefinitely, but must stop at a point limited by the capacity of the memory.
>
>In order to establish quantitative results, we must put some sort of measure (weighting) on the elements of a final superposition. This is necessary to be able to make assertions which hold for almost all of the observer states described by elements of a superposition. We wish to make quantitative statements about the relative frequencies of the different possible results of observation – which are recorded in the memory – for a typical observer state; but to accomplish this we must have a method for selecting a typical element from a superposition of orthogonal states. […]
>
>In our case, we wish to make statements about “trajectories” of observers. However, for us a trajectory is constantly branching (transforming from state to superposition) with each successive measurement. To have a requirement analogous to the “conservation of probability” in the classical case, we demand that the measure assigned to a trajectory at one time shall equal the sum of the measures of its separate branches at a later time. This is precisely the additivity requirement which we imposed and which leads uniquely to the choice of square-amplitude measure. Our procedure is therefore quite as justified as that of classical statistical mechanics. […]
>
>This prescription for the calculation of averages over memory sequences by probabilities assigned to individual elements is precisely that of the conventional “external observation” theory (Process 1). Moreover, these predictions hold for almost all memory sequences. Therefore all predictions of the usual theory will appear to be valid to the observer in almost all observer states.
>
>In particular, the uncertainty principle is never violated since the latest measurement upon a system supplies all possible information about the relative system state, so that there is no direct correlation between any earlier results of observation on the system, and the succeeding observation. Any observation of a quantity B, between two successive observations of quantity A (all on the same system) will destroy the one-one correspondence between the earlier and later memory states for the result of A. Thus for alternating observations of different quantities there are fundamental limitations upon the correlations between memory states for the same observed quantity, these limitations expressing the content of the uncertainty principle.

### Discussion [p. 21]

>The theory based on pure wave mechanics is a conceptually simple, causal theory, which gives predictions in accord with experience. It constitutes a framework in which one can investigate in detail, mathematically, and in a logically consistent manner a number of sometimes puzzling subjects, such as the measuring process itself and the interrelationship of several observers. Objections have been raised in the past to the conventional or “external observation” formulation of quantum theory on the grounds that its probabilistic features are postulated in advance instead of being derived from the theory itself. We believe that the present “relative-state” formulation meets this objection, while retaining all of the content of the standard formulation.
>
>While our theory ultimately justifies the use of the probabilistic interpretation as an aid to making practical predications, it forms a broader frame in which to understand the consistency of that interpretation. In this respect it can be said to form a metatheory for the standard theory. It transcends the usual “external observation” formulation, however, in its ability to deal logically with questions of imperfect observation and approximate measurement.
>
>The “relative state” formulation will apply to all forms of quantum mechanics which maintain the superposition principle. It may therefore prove a fruitful framework for the quantization of general relativity. The formalism invites one to construct the formal theory first, and to supply the statistical interpretation later. This method should be particularly useful for interpreting quantized unified field theories where there is no question of ever isolating observers and object systems. They all are represented in a single structure, the field. Any interpretative rules can probably only be deduced in and through the theory itself.
