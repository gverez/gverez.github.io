### A very brief historical sketch [p. 87]

>We begin with a quote taken from Born (1926), shortly after Heisenberg (1925) had invented matrix mechanics and Schrödinger (1926) his wave mechanics:
>
>>“Neither of these two conceptions appear satisfactory to me. I should like to attempt here to give a third interpretation and to test its utility on collision processes. In this attempt, I adhere to an observation of Einstein on the relationship of wave field and light quanta; he said, for example, that the waves are present only to show the corpuscular light quanta the way, and he spoke in the sense of a “ghost field.” This determines the probability that a light quantum … takes a certain path; … And here it is obvious to regard the de Broglie-Schrödinger waves as the ghost field or, better, “guiding field.”
