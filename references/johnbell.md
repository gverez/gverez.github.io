## On the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics <a name="hidden-variables"></a>
*Reviews of modern physics, pp. 447-452, vol. 38, n. 3, 1966*

### Abstract [p. 1]

>The demonstrations of von Neumann and others, that quantum mechanics does not permit a hidden variable interpretation, are reconsidered. It is shown that their essential axioms are unreasonable. It is urged that in further examination of this problem an interesting axiom would be that mutually distant systems are independent of one another.

### Introduction [p. 1]

>To know the quantum mechanical state of a system implies, in general, only statistical restrictions on the results of measurements. It seems interesting to ask if this statistical element be thought of as arising, as in classical statistical mechanics, because the states in question are averages over better defined states for which individually the results would be quite determined. These hypothetical “dispersion free” states would be specified not only by the quantum mechanical state vector but also by additional “hidden variables” – “hidden” because if states with prescribed values of these variables could actually be prepared, quantum mechanics would be observably inadequate.
>
>Whether this question is indeed interesting has been the subject of debate. The following works contain discussions of and references on the hidden variable problem: L. de Broglie (1953), W. Heisenberg in W. Pauli (1955), S. Körner (1957), N. Hansen (1963). See also the various works by D. Bohm, and Bell and Nauenberg. For the view that the possibility of hidden variables has little interest, see especially the contributions of Rosenfeld, Pauli, Heisenberg and Hansen. Einstein’s “Autobiographical Notes” and “Reply to Critics” suggest that the hidden variable problem has some interest. The present paper does not contribute to that debate. It is addressed to those who do find the question interesting, and more particularly to those among them who believe that “the question concerning the existence of such hidden variables received an early and rather decisive answer in the form of von Neumann’s proof on the mathematical impossibility of such variables in quantum theory.” An attempt will be made to clarify what von Neumann and his successors actually demonstrated. This will cover, as well as von Neumann’s treatment, the recent version of the argument by Jauch and Piron, and the stronger result consequent on the work of Gleason. It will be urged that these analyses leave the real question untouched. In fact it will be seen that these demonstrations require from the hypothetical dispersion free states, not only that appropriate ensembles thereof should have all measurable properties of quantum mechanical states, but certain other properties as well. These additional demands appear reasonable when results of measurement are loosely identified with properties of isolated systems. They are seen to be quite unreasonable when one remembers with Bohr “the impossibility of any sharp distinction between the behavior of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear.”
>
>The realization that von Neumann’s proof is of limited relevance has been gaining ground since the 1952 work of Bohm. However, it is far from universal. Moreover, the writer has not found in the literature any adequate analysis of what went wrong.
>
>In particular the analysis of Bohm seems to lack clarity, or else accuracy. He fully emphasizes the role of the experimental arrangement. However, it seems to be implied that the circumvention of the theorem requires the association of hidden variables with the apparatus as well as with the system observed. The scheme of Sec. II is a counter example to this. Moreover, it will be seen in Sec. III that if the essential additivity assumption of von Neumann were granted, hidden variables wherever located would not avail. Bohm’s further remarks are also unconvincing. Other critiques of the theorem are cited, and some of them rebutted, by Albertson (1961).
>
>Like all authors of noncommissioned reviews, he thinks that he can restate the position with such clarity and simplicity that all previous discussions will be eclipsed.

### Assumptions, and a simple example [p. 2]

>The question at issue is whether the quantum mechanical states can be regarded as ensembles of states further specified by additional variables, such that given values of these variables together with the state vector determine precisely the results of individual measurements. These hypothetical well-specified states are said to be “dispersion free.” […]
>
>For this system a hidden variable scheme can be supplied as follows: The dispersion free states are specified by a real number λ […]. It should be stressed that no physical significance is attributed here to the parameter λ and that no pretence is made of giving a complete reinterpretation of quantum mechanics. The sole aim is to show that at the level considered by von Neumann such a reinterpretation is not excluded. A complete theory would require for example an account of the behavior of the hidden variables during the measurement process itself. With or without hidden variables the analysis of the measurement process presents peculiar difficulties, and we enter upon it no more than is strictly necessary for our very limited purpose.

### Von Neumann [p. 2]

>Consider now the proof of von Neumann that dispersion free states, and so hidden variables, are impossible. […]
>
>But this explanation of the nonadditivity of allowed values also establishes the nontriviality of the additivity of expectation values. The latter is a quite peculiar property of quantum mechanical states, not to be expected a priori. There is no reason to demand it individually of the hypothetical dispersion free states, whose function it is to reproduce the measurable peculiarities of quantum mechanics when averaged over. […]
>
>Thus the formal proof of von Neumann does not justify his informal conclusion: “It is therefore not, as is often assumed, a question of reinterpretation of quantum mechanics – the present system of quantum mechanics would have to be objectively false in order that another description of the elementary process than the statistical one be possible.” It was not the objective measurable predictions of quantum mechanics which ruled out hidden variables. It was the arbitrary assumption of a particular (and impossible) relation between the results of incompatible measurements either of which might be made on a given occasion but only one of which can in fact be made.

### Jauch and Piron [p. 3]

>A new version of the argument has been given by Jauch and Piron. Like von Neumann they are interested in generalized forms of quantum mechanics and do not assume the usual connection of quantum mechanical expectation values with state vectors and operators. We assume the latter and shorten the argument, for we are concerned here only with possible interpretations of ordinary quantum mechanics. […]
>
>So there can be no dispersion free states.
>
>The objection to this is the same as before. We are not dealing with logical propositions, but with measurements involving, for example, differently oriented magnets. The axiom holds for quantum mechanical states. But it is a quite peculiar property of them, in no way a necessity of thought. Only the quantum mechanical averages over the dispersion free states need reproduce this property, as in the example of Sec. II.


### Gleason [p. 4]

>The remarkable mathematical work of Gleason was not explicitly addressed to the hidden variable problem. It was directed to reducing the axiomatic basis of quantum mechanics. However, as it apparently enables von Neumann’s result to be obtained without objectionable assumptions about noncommuting operators, we must clearly consider it. The relevant corollary of Gleason’s work is that, if the dimensionality of the state space is greater than two, the additivity requirement for expectation values of commuting operators cannot be met by dispersion free states. This will now be proved, and then its significance discussed. It should be stressed that Gleason obtained more than this, by a lengthier argument, but this is all that is essential here. […]
>
>Therefore, there are no dispersion free states.
>
>That so much follows from such apparently innocent assumptions leads us to question their innocence. Are the requirements imposed, which are satisfied by quantum mechanical states, reasonable requirements on the dispersion free states? Indeed they are not. […]The danger in fact was not in the explicit but in the implicit assumptions. It was tacitly assumed that measurement of an observable must yield the same value independently of what other measurements may be made simultaneously. […]The result of an observation may reasonably depend not only on the state of the system (including hidden variables) but also on the complete disposition of the apparatus; see again the quotation from Bohr at the end of Sec. I.

### Locality and separability [p. 5]

>Up till now we have been resisting arbitrary demands upon the hypothetical dispersion free states. However, as well as reproducing quantum mechanics on averaging, there are features which can reasonably be desired in a hidden variable scheme. The hidden variables should surely have some spatial significance and should evolve in time according to prescribed laws. These are prejudices, but it is just this possibility of interpolating some (preferably causal) space-time picture, between preparation of and measurements on states, that makes the quest for hidden variables interesting to the unsophisticated. The ideas of space, time, and causality are not prominent in the kind of discussion we have been considering above. To the writer’s knowledge the most successful attempt in that direction is the 1952 scheme of Bohm for elementary wave mechanics. By way of conclusion, this will be sketched briefly, and a curious feature of it stressed. […]
>
>The curious feature is that the trajectory equations for the hidden variables have in general a grossly nonlocal character. […]
>
>So in this theory an explicit causal mechanism exists whereby the disposition of one piece of apparatus affects the results obtained with a distant piece. In fact the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least.
>
>More generally, the hidden variable account of a given system becomes entirely different when we remember that it has undoubtedly interacted with numerous other systems in the past and that the total wave function will certainly not be factorable. The same effect complicates the hidden variable account of the theory of measurement, when it is desired to include part of the “apparatus” in the system.
>
>Bohm of course was well aware of these features of his scheme, and has given them much attention. However, it must be stressed that, to the present writer’s knowledge, there is no proof that any hidden variable account of quantum mechanics must have this extraordinary character (Since the completion of this paper such a proof has been found, Bell (1965)). It would therefore be interesting, perhaps, to pursue some further “impossibility proofs,” replacing the arbitrary axioms objected to above by some condition of locality, or of separability of distant systems.

### The measurement theory of Everett and de Broglie’s pilot wave [p. 93]

>In 1957 H. Everett published a paper setting out what seemed to be a radically new interpretation of quantum mechanics. His approach has recently received increasing attention. He did not refer to the ideas of de Broglie of thirty years before nor to the intervening elaboration of those ideas by Bohm. Yet it will be argued here that the elimination of arbitrary and inessential elements from Everett’s theory leads back to, and throws new light on, the concepts of de Broglie.
>
Everett was motivated by the notion of a quantum theory of gravitation and cosmology. In a thoroughly quantum cosmology, a quantum mechanics of the whole world, the wave function of the world could not be interpreted in the usual way. For this usual interpretation refers only to the statistics of measurement results for an observer intervening from outside the quantum system. When that system is the whole world, there is nothing outside. This situation presents no particular difficulty for the traditional (or ‘Copenhagen’) philosophy, which holds that a classical conception of the macroscopic world is logically prior to the quantum conception of the microscopic. The microscopic world is described by wave functions which are determined by and have implications for macroscopic phenomena in experimental set-ups. These macroscopic phenomena are described in a perfectly classical way (in the language of ‘be-ables’ rather than ‘observables’, so that there is no question of an endless chain of observers observing observers observing…). There is of course no sharply defined boundary between what is to be treated as microscopic and what as macroscopic, and this introduces a basic vagueness into fundamental physical theory. But this vagueness, because of the immense difference of scale between the atomic level where quantum concepts are essential and the macroscopic level where classical concepts are adequate, is quantitatively insignificant in any situation hitherto envisaged. So, it is quite acceptable to many people. It is not surprising then that such a consistent traditionalist as L. Rosenfeld has gone so far as to suggest that a quantum theory of gravitation may be unnecessary. The only gravitational phenomena we actually know are of macroscopic scale and involve very many atoms. So we only need the concept of gravitation on this classical level, whose separate logical status is anyway fundamental in the traditional view. Nevertheless, I think that most contemporary physicists would regard any purely classical theory of gravitation as provisional, and hold that any really adequate theory must be applicable, in principle, also on the microscopic level – even if its effects there are negligibly small. Many of these same contemporary physicists are perfectly complacent about the vague division of the world into classical macroscopic and quantum microscopic inherent in contemporary (i.e., traditional) quantum theory. This mixture of concern on the one hand and complacency on the other is in my opinion less admirable than the clear headed and systematic complacency of Rosenfeld.
>
>Everett was complacent neither about gravitation nor quantum theory. As a preliminary to a synthesis of the two he sought to interpret the notion of a wave function for the world. This world certainly contains instruments that can detect, and record macroscopically, microscopic and other phenomena. […]
>
>An exponent of the traditional view, if he allowed himself to contemplate a wave function of the world, would probably say the following. Once a macroscopic record has been formed we are concerned with fact rather than possibility, and the wave function must be adjusted to take account of this. So from time to time the wave function is ‘reduced’ […] where the restricted summation is over a group of states which are ‘macroscopically indistinguishable’. The complete set of states is divided into many such groups, and the reduction to a particular group occurs with probability proportional to its total weight. […] He will not be able to say just when or how often this reduction should be made, but would be able to show by analyzing examples that the ambiguity is quantitatively unimportant in practice. Everett disposes of this vaguely defined suspension of the linear Schrödinger equation with the following bold proposal: it is just an illusion that the physical world makes a particular choice among the many macroscopic possibilities contained in the expansion; they are all realized, and no reduction of the wave function occurs. He seems to envisage the world as a multiplicity of ‘branch’ worlds, one corresponding to each term in the expansion. Each observer has representatives in many branches, but the representative in any particular branch is aware only of the corresponding particular memory state. So he will remember a more or less continuous sequence of past ‘events’, just as if he were living in a more or less well defined single branch world, and have no awareness of other branches. Everett actually goes further than this, and tries to associate each particular branch at the present time with some particular branch at any past time in a tree-like structure, in such a way that each representative of an observer has actually lived through the particular past that he remembers. In my opinion this attempt does not succeed and is in any case against the spirit of Everett’s emphasis on memory contents as the important thing. We have no access to the past, but only to present memories. A present memory of a correct experiment having been performed should be associated with a present memory of a correct result having been obtained. If physical theory can account for such correlations in present memories it has done enough – at least in the spirit of Everett.
>
>Rejecting the impulse to dismiss Everett’s multiple universe as science fiction, we raise here a couple of questions about it.
>
>The first is based on this observation: there are infinitely many different expansions […], corresponding to the infinitely many complete sets. Is there then an additional multiplicity of universes corresponding to the infinitely many terms in each expansion? I think (I am not sure) that the answer is no, and that Everett confines his interpretation to a particular expansion. […] Then we can say that Everett’s structure is based on an expansion in which instrument readings, rather than operators […], are diagonalized. This preference for a particular set of operators is not dictated by the mathematical structure of the wave function. It is just added (only tacitly by Everett, and only if I have not misunderstood) to make the model reflect human experience. The existence of such a preferred set of variables is one of the elements in the close correspondence between Everett’s theory and de Broglie’s – where the positions of particles have a particular role.
>
>The second question grows out of the first: if instrument readings are to be given such a fundamental role should we not be told more exactly what an instrument reading is, or indeed, an instrument, or a storage unit in a memory, or whatever? In dividing the world into pieces […] Everett is indeed following an old convention of abstract quantum measurement theory, that the world does fall neatly into such pieces – instruments and systems. In my opinion this is an unfortunate convention. The real world is made of electrons and protons and so on, and as a result the boundaries of natural objects are fuzzy, and some particles in the boundary can only doubtfully be assigned to either object or environment. I think that fundamental physical theory should be so formulated that such artificial divisions are manifestly inessential. In my opinion Everett has not given such a formulation – and de Broglie has.
>
>So we come finally to de Broglie. Long ago he faced the basic duality of quantum theory. For a single particle the mathematical wave extends over space, but the experience is particulate, like a scintillation on a screen. […] De Broglie made the simple and natural suggestion: the wave function is not a complete description of reality, but must be supplemented by other variables. For a single particle he adds to the wave function a particle coordinate – the instantaneous position of the localized particle in the extended wave. [...]To make a model of the world, a simple world consisting just of many non-relativistic particles, we have only to extend these prescriptions from 3 to 3N dimensions, where N is the total number of particles. In this world the many-body wave function obeys exactly a many-body Schrödinger equation. There is no ‘wave function reduction’. […] This model is like Everett’s in employing a world wave function and an exact Schrödinger equation, and in superposing on this wave function an additional structure involving a preferred set of variables. The main differences seem to me to be these.
>
>(1) Whereas Everett’s special variables are the vaguely anthropocentric instrument readings, de Broglie’s are related to an assumed microscopic structure of the world. The macroscopic features of direct interest to human beings, like instrument readings, can be brought out by suitably coarsegrained averaging, but the ambiguities in doing so do not enter the fundamental formulation.
>
>(2) Whereas Everett assumes that all configurations of his special variables are realized at any time, each in the appropriate branch universe, the de Broglie world has a particular configuration. 1 do not myself see that anything useful is achieved by the assumed existence of the other branches of which I am not aware. But let he who finds this assumption inspiring make it. […]
>
>(3) Whereas Everett makes no attempt, or only a half-hearted one, to link successive configurations of the world into continuous trajectories, de Broglie does just this in a perfectly deterministic way (G). Now these trajectories of de Broglie, innocent as (G) may look in the configuration space, are really very peculiar as regards locality in ordinary three-space. But we learn from Everett that if we do not like these trajectories we can simply leave them out. We could just as well redistribute the configuration at random from one instant to the next. For we have no access to the past, but only to memories, and these memories are just part of the instantaneous configuration of the world.
>
>Does this final synthesis, omitting de Broglie’s trajectories and Everett’s other branches, make a satisfactory formulation of fundamental physical theory? Or rather would some variation of it based on a relativistic field theory? It is logically coherent, and does not need to supplement mathematical equations with vague recipes. But I do not like it. Emotionally, I would like to take more seriously the past of the world (and of myself) than this theory would permit. More professionally, I am uneasy about the possibility of incorporating relativity in a profound way. No doubt it would be possible to ensure memory of a null result for the Michelson-Morley experiment and so on. But could the basic reality be other than the state of world, or at least a memory, extended in space at a single time – defining a preferred Lorentz frame? To try to elaborate on this would only be to try to share my confusion.

### Free variables and local causality [p. 100]

>It has been argued that quantum mechanics is not locally causal and cannot be embedded in a locally causal theory. That conclusion depends on treating certain experimental parameters, typically the orientations of polarization filters, as free variables. Roughly speaking it is supposed that an experimenter is quite free to choose among the various possibilities offered by his equipment. But it might be that this apparent freedom is illusory. Perhaps experimental parameters and experimental results are both consequences, or partially so, of some common hidden mechanism. Then the apparent non-locality could be simulated.
>
>This possibility is the starting point of a paper by Clauser, Horne and Shimony (CHS hereafter), which is valuable in particular for a careful mathematical formulation of the assumption which excludes such a conspiracy. In this connection they severely criticize my own ‘theory of local beables’ (B hereafter). Much of their criticism is perfectly just. In B there were jumps in the argument, and the assumption in question was not stated at the appropriate place, but only later and inadequately. However, I do not agree with CHS that this assumption, when carefully formulated, is an unreasonable one. […]
>
>Here I would entertain the hypothesis that experimenters have free will. But according to CHS it would not be permissible for me to justify the assumption of free variables ‘by relying on a metaphysics which has not been proved and which may well be false’. Disgrace indeed, to be caught in a metaphysical position! But it seems to me that in this matter I am just pursuing my profession of theoretical physics.
>
>I would insist here on the distinction between analyzing various physical theories, on the one hand, and philosophising about the unique real world on the other hand. In this matter of causality it is a great inconvenience that the real world is given to us once only. We cannot know what would have happened if something had been different. We cannot repeat an experiment changing just one variable; the hands of the clock will have moved, and the moons of Jupiter. Physical theories are more amenable in this respect. We can calculate the consequences of changing free elements in a theory, be they only initial conditions, and so can explore the causal structure of the theory. I insist that B is primarily an analysis of certain kinds of physical theory.

### De Broglie-Bohm, delayed-choice double-slit experiment, and density matrix [p. 111]

>I will try to interest you in the de Broglie-Bohm version of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It is, in my opinion, very instructive. It is experimentally equivalent to the usual version insofar as the latter is unambiguous. But it does not require, in its very formulation, a vague division of the world into ‘system’ and ‘apparatus,’ nor of history into ‘measurement’ and ‘nonmeasurement.’ So it applies to the world at large, and not just to idealized laboratory procedures. Indeed the de Broglie-Bohm theory is sharp where the usual one is fuzzy, and general where the usual one is special. […]
>
>Consider now the de Broglie–Bohm version. To the question ‘wave or particle?’ they answer ‘wave and particle.’ The wave is that of wave mechanics – but conceived, in the tradition of Maxwell and Einstein, as an objective field, and not just as some ‘ghost wave’ of information (of some presumably well-informed observer?). The particle rides along on the wave at some position with velocity. […]
>
>In this picture the wave always goes through both slits (as is the nature of waves) and the particle goes through only one (as is the nature of particles). […] It is vital here to put away the classical prejudice that a particle moves on a straight path in ‘field-free’ space – free, that is, from fields other than the de Broglie-Bohm! […]
>
>That the theory is supposed to apply fundamentally to the world as a whole requires ultimately that any ‘observers’ be included in the system. This raises no particular problem so long as they are conceived as not essentially different from computers, equipped perhaps with ‘random’ number generators. Then everything is in fact predetermined at the fundamental level – including the ‘late’ decision whether to insert the plate. To include creatures with genuine free will would require some development, and here the de Broglie-Bohm version might develop differently from the usual approach. To make the issue experimental would require identification of situations in which the differences between computers and free agents were essential. That the guiding wave, in the general case, propagates not in ordinary three-space but in a multidimensional-configuration space is the origin of the notorious ‘nonlocality’ of quantum mechanics. It is a merit of the de Broglie-Bohm version to bring this out so explicitly that it cannot be ignored.

### Bertlmann’s socks and the nature of reality [p. 139]

>The philosopher in the street, who has not suffered a course in quantum mechanics, is quite unimpressed by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. He can point to many examples of similar correlations in everyday life. The case of Bertlmann’s socks is often cited. Dr. Bertlmann likes to wear two socks of different colours. Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable. But when you see that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink. Observation of the first, and experience of Bertlmann, gives immediate information about the second. There is no accounting for tastes, but apart from that there is no mystery here. And is not the EPR business just the same? […]
>
>Making a virtue of necessity, and influenced by positivistic and instrumentalist philosophies, many came to hold not only that it is difficult to find a coherent picture but that it is wrong to look for one – if not actually immoral then certainly unprofessional. Going further still, some asserted that atomic and subatomic particles do not have any definite properties in advance of observation. There is nothing, that is to say, in the particles approaching the magnet, to distinguish those subsequently deflected up from those subsequently deflected down. Indeed even the particles are not really there.
>
>For example, ‘Bohr once declared when asked whether the quantum mechanical algorithm could be considered as somehow mirroring an underlying quantum reality: “There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum mechanical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature”’.
>
>And for Heisenberg ‘… in the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts’.
>
>And ‘Jordan declared, with emphasis, that observations not only disturb what has to be measured, they produce it. In a measurement of position, for example, as performed with the gamma ray microscope, “the electron is forced to a decision. We compel it to assume a definite position; previously it was, in general, neither here nor there; it had not yet made its decision for a definite position… If by another experiment the velocity of the electron is being measured, this means: the electron is compelled to decide itself for some exactly defined value of the velocity… we ourselves produce the results of measurement”’.
>
>It is in the context of ideas like these that one must envisage the discussion of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. Then it is a little less unintelligible that the EPR paper caused such a fuss, and that the dust has not settled even now. It is as if we had come to deny the reality of Bertlmann’s socks, or at least of their colours, when not looked at. And as if a child has asked: How come they always choose different colours when they are looked at? How does the second sock know what the first has done?
>
>Paradox indeed! But for the others, not for EPR. EPR did not use the word ‘paradox’. They were with the man in the street in this business. For them these correlations simply showed that the quantum theorists had been hasty in dismissing the reality of the microscopic world. In particular Jordan had been wrong in supposing that nothing was real or fixed in that world before observation. For after observing only one particle the result of subsequently observing the other (possibly at a very remote place) is immediately predictable. Could it be that the first observation somehow fixes what was unfixed, or makes real what was unreal, not only for the near particle but also for the remote one? For EPR that would be an unthinkable ‘spooky action at a distance’. To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story.
>
>It is important to note that to the limited degree to which determinism plays a role in the EPR argument, it is not assumed but inferred. What is held sacred is the principle of ‘local causality’ - or ‘no action at a distance’. Of course, mere correlation between distant events does not by itself imply action at a distance, but only correlation between the signals reaching the two places. These signals, in the idealized example of Bohm, must be sufficient to determine whether the particles go up or down. For any residual undeterminism could only spoil the perfect correlation.
>
>It is remarkably difficult to get this point across, that determinism is not a presupposition of the analysis. There is a widespread and erroneous conviction that for Einstein determinism was always the sacred principle. The quotability of his famous ‘God does not play dice’ has not helped in this respect. Among those who had great difficulty in seeing Einstein’s position was Born. Pauli tried to help him in a letter of 1954:
>
>>“… I was unable to recognize Einstein whenever you talked about him in either your letter or your manuscript. It seemed to me as if you had erected some dummy Einstein for yourself, which you then knocked down with great pomp. In particular Einstein does not consider the concept of ‘determinism’ to be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be (as he told me emphatically many times) … he disputes that he uses as a criterion for the admissibility of a theory the question: ‘Is it rigorously deterministic?’… he was not at all annoyed with you, but only said you were a person who will not listen.”
>
>Born had particular difficulty with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument. Here is his summing up, long afterwards, when he edited the Born-Einstein correspondence.
>
>>“The root of the difference between Einstein and me was the axiom that events which happen in different places A and B are independent of one another, in the sense that an observation on the state of affairs at B cannot teach us anything about the state of affairs at A.”
>
>Misunderstanding could hardly be more complete. Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an intervention at one place could influence, immediately, affairs at the other.
>
>These references to Born are not meant to diminish one of the towering figures of modern physics. They are meant to illustrate the difficulty of putting aside preconceptions and listening to what is actually being said. They are meant to encourage you, dear listener, to listen a little harder.
>
>Here, finally, is a summing-up by Einstein himself:
>
>>“If one asks what, irrespective of quantum mechanics, is characteristic of the world of ideas of physics, one is first of all struck by the following: the concepts of physics relate to a real outside world. … It is further characteristic of these physical objects that they are thought of as arranged in a space-time, continuum. An essential aspect of this arrangement of things in physics is that they lay claim, at a certain time, to an existence independent of one another, provided these objects ‘are situated in different parts of space’.
>>
>>The following idea characterizes the relative independence of objects far apart in space (A and B): external influence on A has no direct influence on B…
>>
>>There seems to me no doubt that those physicists who regard the descriptive methods of quantum mechanics as definitive in principle would react to this line of thought in the following way: they would drop the requirement… for the independent existence of the physical reality present in different parts of space; they would be justified in pointing out that the quantum theory nowhere makes explicit use of this requirement.
>>
>>I admit this, but would point out: when I consider the physical phenomena known to me, and especially those which are being so successfully encompassed by quantum mechanics, I still cannot find any fact anywhere which would make it appear likely that (that) requirement will have to be abandoned.
>>
>>I am therefore inclined to believe that the description of quantum mechanics … has to be regarded as an incomplete and indirect description of reality, to be replaced at some later date by a more complete and direct one.” […]
>
>Let us summarize once again the logic that leads to the impasse. The EPRB correlations are such that the result of the experiment on one side immediately foretells that on the other, whenever the analyzers happen to be parallel. If we do not accept the intervention on one side as a causal influence on the other, we seem obliged to admit that the results on both sides are determined in advance anyway, independently of the intervention on the other side, by signals from the source and by the local magnet setting. But this has implications for non-parallel settings which conflict with those of quantum mechanics. So we cannot dismiss intervention on one side as a causal influence on the other.
>
>It would be wrong to say ‘Bohr wins again’; the argument was not known to the opponents of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. But certainly Einstein could no longer write so easily, speaking of local causality ‘… I still cannot find any fact anywhere which would make it appear likely that that requirement will have to be abandoned’.

>By way of conclusion I will comment on four possible positions that might be taken on this business – without pretending that they are the only possibilities.

>First, and those of us who are inspired by Einstein would like this best, quantum mechanics may be wrong in sufficiently critical situations. Perhaps Nature is not so queer as quantum mechanics. But the experimental situation is not very encouraging from this point of view. […]

>Secondly, it may be that it is not permissible to regard the experimental settings in the analyzers as independent variables, as we did. […]

>Thirdly, it may be that we have to admit that causal influences do go faster than light. The role of Lorentz invariance in the completed theory would then be very problematic. An ‘aether’ would be the cheapest solution. But the unobservability of this aether would be disturbing. So would the impossibility of ‘messages’ faster than light, which follows from ordinary relativistic quantum mechanics in so far as it is unambiguous and adequate for procedures we can actually perform. The exact elucidation of concepts like ‘message’ and ‘we’, would be a formidable challenge.

>Fourthly and finally, it may be that Bohr’s intuition was right – in that there is no reality below some ‘classical’ macroscopic level. Then fundamental physical theory would remain fundamentally vague, until concepts like ‘macroscopic’ could be made sharper than they are today.


### On the impossible pilot wave [p. 159]

>When I was a student I had much difficulty with quantum mechanics. It was comforting to find that even Einstein had had such difficulties for a long time. Indeed they had led him to the heretical conclusion that something was missing in the theory. […]

>Einstein did not seem to know that this possibility, of peaceful coexistence between quantum statistical predictions and a more complete theoretical description, had been disposed of with great rigour by J. von Neumann. I myself did not know von Neumann’s demonstration at first hand, for at that time it was available only in German, which I could not read. However I knew of it from the beautiful book by Born, Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance, which was in fact one of the highlights of my physics education. Discussing how physics might develop Born wrote:

>>“I expect… that, we shall have to sacrifice some current ideas and to use still more abstract methods.’ However these are only opinions. A more concrete contribution to this question has been made by J. v. Neumann in his brilliant book, Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik. He puts the theory on an axiomatic basis by deriving it from a few postulates of a very plausible and general character, about the properties of ‘expectation values’ (averages) and their representation by mathematical symbols. The result is that the formalism of quantum mechanics is uniquely determined by these axioms; in particular, no concealed parameters can be introduced with the help of which the indeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic one. Hence if a future theory should be deterministic, it cannot be a modification of the present one but must be essentially different. How this could be possible without sacrificing a whole treasure of well established results I leave to the determinists to worry about.”

>Having read this, I relegated the question to the back of my mind and got on with more practical things. But in 1952 I saw the impossible done. It was in papers by David Bohm. Bohm showed explicitly how parameters could indeed be introduced, into nonrelativistic wave mechanics, with the help of which the indeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic one. More importantly, in my opinion, the subjectivity of the orthodox version, the necessary reference to the ‘observer,’ could be eliminated.

>Moreover, the essential idea was one that had been advanced already by de Broglie in 1927, in his ‘pilot wave’ picture.

>But why then had Born not told me of this ‘pilot wave’? If only to point out what was wrong with it? Why did von Neumann not consider it? More extraordinarily, why did people go on producing ‘impossibility’ proofs after 1952, and as recently as 1978? When even Pauli, Rosenfeld and Heisenberg could produce no more devastating criticism of Bohm’s version than to brand it as ‘metaphysical’ and ‘ideological’? Why is the pilot wave picture ignored in text books? Should it not be taught, not as the only way, but as an antidote to the prevailing complacency? To show that vagueness, subjectivity, and indeterminism, are not forced on us by experimental facts, but by deliberate theoretical choice?

>I will not attempt here to answer these questions. But, since the pilot wave picture still needs advertising, I will make here another modest attempt to publicize it. […]

>It is easy to find good reasons for disliking the de Broglie-Bohm picture. Neither de Broglie nor Bohm liked it very much; for both of them it was only a point of departure. Einstein also did not like it very much. He found it ‘too cheap,’ although, as Born remarked, ‘it was quite in line with his own ideas’. But like it or lump it, it is perfectly conclusive as a counter example to the idea that vagueness, subjectivity, or indeterminism, are forced on us by the experimental facts covered by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.
