## Remarks on the mind-body question <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Philosophical Reflections and Syntheses, 1995*

### Introductory comments [p. 171]

>F. Dyson, in a very thoughtful article, points to the everbroadening scope of scientific inquiry. Whether or not the relation of mind to body will enter the realm of scientific inquiry in the near future – and the present writer is prepared to admit that this is an open question – it seems worthwhile to summarize the views to which a dispassionate contemplation of the most obvious facts leads. The present writer has no other qualification to offer his views than has any other physicist and he believes that most of his colleagues would present similar opinions on the subject, if pressed.
>
>Until not many years ago, the “existence” of a mind or soul would have been passionately denied by most physical scientists. The brilliant successes of mechanistic and, more generally, macroscopic physics and of chemistry overshadowed the obvious fact that thoughts, desires, and emotions are not made of matter, and it was nearly universally accepted among physical scientists that there is nothing besides matter. The epitome of this belief was the conviction that, if we knew the positions and velocities of all atoms at one instant of time, we could compute the fate of the universe for all future. Even today, there are adherents to this view though fewer among the physicists than – ironically enough – among biochemists. […]
>
>It may be premature to believe that the present philosophy of quantum mechanics will remain a permanent feature of future physical theories; it will remain remarkable, in whatever way our future concepts may develop, that the very study of the external world led to the conclusion that the content of the consciousness is an ultimate reality.
>
>It is perhaps important to point out at this juncture that the question concerning the existence of almost anything (even the whole external world) is not a very relevant question. All of us recognize at once how meaningless the query concerning the existence of the electric field in vacuum would be. All that is relevant is that the concept of the electric field is useful for communicating our ideas and for our own thinking. The statement that it “exists” means only that: (a) it can be measured, hence uniquely defined, and (b) that its knowledge is useful for understanding past phenomena and in helping to foresee further events. It can be made part of the Weltbild. This observation may well be kept in mind during the ensuing discussion of the quantum mechanical description of the external world.

### The language of quantum mechanics [p. 174]

>The information given by the wave function is communicable. If someone else somehow determines the wave function of a system, he can tell me about it and, according to the theory, the probabilities for the possible different impressions (or “sensations”) will be equally large, no matter whether he or I interact with the system in a given fashion. In this sense, the wave function “exists.”

### An example [p. 175]

>The probabilities of the various possible impressions gained at the next interaction may depend not only on the last, but on the results of many prior observations. The important point is that the impression which one gains at an interaction may, and in general does, modify the probabilities with which one gains the various possible impressions at later interactions. In other words, the impression which one gains at an interaction, called also the result of an observation, modifies the wave function of the system. The modified wave function is, furthermore, in general unpredictable before the impression gained at the interaction has entered our consciousness: it is the entering of an impression into our consciousness which alters the wave function because it modifies our appraisal of the probabilities for different impressions which we expect to receive in the future. It is at this point that the consciousness enters the theory unavoidably and unalterably. If one speaks in terms of the wave function, its changes are coupled with the entering of impressions into our consciousness. If one formulates the laws of quantum mechanics in terms of probabilities of impressions, these are ipso facto the primary concepts with which one deals.
>
>It is natural to inquire about the situation if one does not make the observation oneself but lets someone else carry it out. What is the wave function if my friend looked at the place where the flash might show at time t? The answer is that the information available about the object cannot be described by a wave function. One could attribute a wave function to the joint system: friend plus object, and this joint system would have a wave function also after the interaction, that is, after my friend has looked. I can then enter into interaction with this joint system by asking my friend whether he saw a flash. If his answer gives me the impression that he did, the joint wave function of friend + object will change into one in which they even have separate wave functions (the total wave function is a product). […] However, even in this case, in which the observation was carried out by someone else, the typical change in the wave function occurred only when some information (the yes or no of my friend) entered my consciousness. It follows that the quantum description of objects is influenced by impressions entering my consciousness. Solipsism may be logically consistent with present quantum mechanics, monism in the sense of materialism is not. The case against solipsism was given at the end of the first section.

### The reasons for materialism [p. 176]

>The principal argument against materialism is not that illustrated in the last two sections: that it is incompatible with quantum theory. The principal argument is that thought processes and consciousness are the primary concepts, that our knowledge of the external world is the content of our consciousness and that the consciousness, therefore, cannot be denied. On the contrary, logically, the external world could be denied – though it is not very practical to do so. In the words of Niels Bohr, “The word consciousness, applied to ourselves as well as to others, is indispensable when dealing with the human situation.” In view of all this, one may well wonder how materialism, the doctrine that “life could be explained by sophisticated combinations of physical and chemical laws,” could so long be accepted by the majority of scientists.

### Simplest answer to the mind-body question [p. 178]

>With what probability will I have one of the several possible sensations? This is clearly a valid and important question which refers to a concept – sensations – which does not exist in present-day physics or chemistry. […]
>
>Everybody believes that the phenomenon of sensations is widely shared by organisms which we consider to be living. It is very likely that, if certain physico-chemical conditions are satisfied, a consciousness, that is, the property of having sensations, arises. This statement will be referred to as our first thesis.
>
>The physico-chemical conditions and properties of the substrate not only create the consciousness, they also influence its sensations most profoundly. Does, conversely, the consciousness influence the physico-chemical conditions? In other words, does the human body deviate from the laws of physics, as gleaned from the study of inanimate nature? The traditional answer to this question is, “No”: the body influences the mind but the mind does not influence the body. Yet at least two reasons can be given to support the opposite thesis, which will be referred to as the second thesis. […]
>
>The second argument to support the existence of an influence of the consciousness on the physical world is based on the observation that we do not know of any phenomenon in which one subject is influenced by another without exerting an influence thereupon. This appears convincing to this writer. […] Mechanical objects influence light – otherwise we could not see them – but experiments to demonstrate the effect of light on the motion of mechanical bodies are difficult. It is unlikely that the effect would have been detected had theoretical considerations not suggested its existence, and its manifestation in the phenomenon of light pressure.


### More difficult questions [p. 182]

>Light quanta do not influence each other directly but only by influencing material bodies which then influence other light quanta. Even in this indirect way, their interaction is appreciable only under exceptional circumstances. Similarly, consciousnesses never seem to interact with each other directly but only via the physical world. Hence, any knowledge about the consciousness of another being must be mediated by the physical world.
>
>At this point, however, the analogy stops. Light quanta can interact directly with virtually any material object but each consciousness is uniquely related to some physico-chemical structure through which alone it receives impressions. There is, apparently, a correlation between each consciousness and the physico-chemical structure of which it is a captive, which has no analogue in the inanimate world. […]
>
>It follows that there are only two avenues through which experimentation can proceed to obtain information about our first thesis: observation of infants where we may be able to sense the progress of the awakening of consciousness, and by discovering phenomena postulated by the second thesis, in which the consciousness modifies the usual laws of physics.


### Non-linearity of equations as indication of life [p. 183]

>The preceding section gave two proofs – they might better be called indications – for the second thesis, the effect of consciousness on physical phenomena. The first of these was directly connected with an actual process, the quantum mechanical observation, and indicated that the usual description of an indirect observation is probably incorrect if the primary observation is made by a being with consciousness. […]
>
>The simplest way out of the difficulty is to accept the conclusion which forced itself on us: to assume that the joint system of friend plus object cannot be described by a wave function after the interaction – the proper description of their state is a mixture. […] It was pointed out already by Bohm that, if the system is sufficiently complicated, it may be in practice impossible to ascertain a difference between certain mixtures, and some pure states (states which can be described by a wave function). […] This way out of the difficulty amounts to the postulate that the equations of motion of quantum mechanics cease to be linear, in fact that they are grossly non-linear if conscious beings enter the picture.
