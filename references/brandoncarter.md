## Classical anthropic Everett model: indeterminacy in a preordained multiverse <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Journal of Cosmology, vol. 14, 2011*

### Abstract

>Although ultimately motivated by quantum theoretical considerations, Everett’s many-world idea remains valid, as an approximation, in the classical limit. However to be applicable it must in any case be applied in conjunction with an appropriate anthropic principle, whose precise formulation involves an anthropic quotient that can be normalised to unity for adult humans but that would be lower for infants and other animals. The outcome is a deterministic multiverse in which the only function of chance is the specification of one’s particular identity.

### Introduction

>Before the twentieth century, classical probabilistic models – such as those developed by Maxwell and Boltzmann for the treatment of many particle systems – were commonly considered as approximations of an objective deterministic reality of which the details were unknown or at any rate too complicated to be tractable. However since the advent of quantum theory, it has come to be widely recognised that – as Berkeley had warned – such an objective material reality may not exist. […]
>
>According to our modern understanding, classical probabilistic models should be considered as approximations, not of illusory material reality, but of more elaborate quantum theoretical models, whose interpretation is to a large extent subjective rather than objective. A complete understanding would therefor require a theory of the sentient mind – as distinct from, though correlated with, the physical brain.
>
>The question of the relationship between our physical brains – the object of study by neurologists – and the thoughts and feelings in our “conscious” minds was already a subject of philosophical speculation long before the development of quantum theory. As very little substantial progress had been achieved, it was natural that some people should wonder whether a resolution of the mystery of quantum theory might provide a resolution of the mystery of the mind. A more common opinion has however been expressed by Steven Weinberg (1995), who wrote “Of course everything is ultimately quantum mechanical: the question is whether quantum mechanics will appear directly in the theory of the mind, and not just in the deeper level theories like chemistry on which the theories of the mind will be based ... Penrose may be right about that, but I doubt it.”
>
>I am inclined to share this common opinion, and will proceed here on that basis, not just because of the relatively macroscopic (multiparticle) nature of the neurons constituting the brain, but because quantum theory is not really essential for what is commonly considered to be the crux of the mind to matter relationship, namely what is known as the “collapse” of the “wave function” which is supposed to result from an observation of the kind exemplified by Schrödinger’s gedanken experiment in which a cat in a box is liable to be killed by a pistol triggered by a Geiger counter.

### The trouble with the traditional doctrine

>According to the “Copenhagen” interpretation, the relevant “wave function” collapses either to a pure state in which the cat is unambiguously alive, or else one in which it is unambigously dead, when a human “observer” opens its box. The trouble with the Copenhagen interpretation is that it denies “observer” status to the occupant of the box, which is questionable even in the case of a humble cat, and would clearly be quite inadmissible if the cat were replaced by another human.
>
>However as well as the underlying symmetry between the person at risk and the person who observes, the point I want to emphasize here is that the issue is not essentially quantum mechanical, because it subsists even if one goes over to the (decoherent) classical limit. In the human case, an analogous classical experiment can be – and historically has been – done with the Geiger triggering mechanism replaced by use of an old fashionned Russian roulette revolver. The classical analogue of the “collapse of the wave function” would be the Bayesian reduction of the corresponding classical probability distribution, from an a priori configuration, in which the outcome is uncertain, to an a posteriori configuration in which the subject of the experiment is either unambiguously alive or else unambiguously dead. To the question of which protagonist has the privilege of making the observation whereby the definitive “collapse” occurs, it is traditionally presumed that Bishop Berkeley’s reply would have been been “God!”. However physicists (since the time of Laplace) have tried to avoid such ad hoc invocation of a “deus ex machina”, and (in the spirit of Ockham’s razor) are therefore inclined to prefer the alternative reply that is expressible succinctly as “None!”. Such negation was originally proposed by Everett, and was advocated – but not adequately elucidated – first by Wheeler and subsequently by DeWitt (1973). By thus denying the Copenhagen doctrine of the occurrence of “collapse” as an objective physical process – rather than merely a subjective allowance for new information as in the familiar classical case of Bayesian reduction – Everett got off to a good start. However his attempt to provide a positive interpretation of the meaning of the “wave function” was not entirely successful.
>
>Part of the trouble arose merely from misunderstanding, due to injudicious choice of wording, whereby what I would prefer to refer to as alternative “channels” were called “branches”, thereby conveying the misleading idea of a continual multiplication of worlds (Leslie 1996), whereas (since Everett’s idea was that evolution remains strictly unitary) the “worlds” in question are strictly conserved, having neither beginning nor end: what changes is only the resolution of distinction between different “channels”, which may become finer (or coarser!) as observational information is acquired (or lost!). A more serious – since not merely semantic – problem by which many people have been puzzled is what Graham (1973) has called the “dilemma” posed by Everett’s declaration that the alternative possible outcomes of an observation are all “equally real” though not (if their quantum amplitudes are different) “equally probable”. As I have argued previously (Carter 2004), and will maintain here, the resolution of this dilemma requires the invocation of an appropriate anthropic principle.

### The concept of reality
>It was recognised long ago by Berkeley, and has been emphasized more recently by Page (1996), that the only kinds of entities we know for sure to be real are our mental feelings and perceptions (including dreams). The material world in which we have the impression of living is essentially just a theoretical construct to account for our perceptions. In the dualist (Cartesian) picture that used to be widely accepted, this material world was supposed to have a reality of its own, on par with the realm of feelings and perceptions. However under closer scrutinary such separate material reality has turned out to be illusive, so we find ourselves glimpsing a more mysterious but apparently unified quantum picture. Following the approach initiated by Everett (DeWitt 1973; Graham 1973), diverse attempts to sketch the outlines of such a unified picture have been made, albeit with only rather limited success so far, by various people (Deutsch 1999; Wallace 2003; Reaves 2004), and in particular – from a point of view closer to that adopted here – by Page (1996) and the present author (Carter 2004). […]
>
>The picture proposed here is based on the use of an appropriate anthropic principle in conjunction with the Everett approach, which is relatively well defined in the classical limit, so that the notions of “equal reality” and “unequal probability” can be clarified in a coherent manner.
>
>Deutsch (1999), Wallace (2003), and Greaves (2004) have developed an alternative approach that attempts to do this in terms of the kind of probability postulated in decision theory, on the debatable supposition that the relevant observations are performed by “rational agents”. The essentially different approach advocated here is based on probability of a kind proportional to the amount of perception that is “real”, in the sense not of Deutsch (1997) but of Page (1996) – as based on sentience rather than rationality. Following a line of thought originated by Dyson (1979), I have suggested that the relevant amount of perception should in principle be measured by the corresponding Shannon type information content, but in practice that does not tell us much, as it leaves us with the unsolved question of which of the many processes going on in the brain are the ones that actually correspond to sentient perception.

### Russian roulette: a historical example

>To illustrate the basic idea, I propose to consider a modified Schrödinger type experiment in which G – an unbalanced adolescent at the time – voluntarily and crazily took the role of the cat, in a solitary game of Russian roulette. The role of the external observer was taken by his big brother (the owner of the revolver) to whom I shall refer by the letter B. […] To keep the arithmetic simple, I shall postulate that the revolver was just a five-shooter, of the compact kind that is most convenient as a concealed weapon. […]
>
>According to the traditional single-world doctrine of deterministic classical physics (as still taken for granted at the time of the incident in question) only one of the five possible outcomes would have actually occurred. However according to the Everett type many-world doctrine, a complete description will involve many separately conserved “strands” (commonly but misleadingly referred to as “branches”) meaning single worlds of all the five types, in a multiverse consisting of five equally numerous sub-ensembles or “channels”, one for each qualitatively distinct possibility. Such sub-ensembles will be characterised by a physical measure given by the fraction p of the total number of strands, which in this case is p = 1/5 for each one. Since the four possibilities in which G survives would have been effectively distinguishable (by an examination of the weapon) only for a very short time after the experiment, it will in practice be sufficient for most subsequent purposes to use a coarser representation in which they are regrouped into a single larger multistrand “channel”, which will thus have measure p = 4/5. When Everett refers to things as “equally real” it is clear that he should be understood to have in mind the individual (single world) strands, rather than their weighted groupings into broader “channels”.
>
>The stage at which the original presentation of the Everett approach becomes unclear is when it is suggested that the physical weighting introduced as described should somehow be interpreted as a probability, despite the fact that (as the classical limit of evolution that is strictly unitary in the quantum case) the behaviour of the many worlds involved is entirely deterministic, so that when their initial configurations have been specified no uncertainties remain.
>
>To give a meaning to the concept of probability in this context, the purely materialistic framework of the classical many-world system described so far needs to be extended to include allowance for the role of mind. For the simplified classical model considered here, it will be good enough to do this in the usual way, by supposing that mental feelings and perceptions correspond to physical states of animate brains that are roughly localisable on time parametrised world lines of the animals concerned within the single world “strands”.


### Anthropic quotient

>Within the foregoing framework, the incorporation of probability into the model is achieved by an appropriate application of the anthropic principle. In the simple (weak) version that is adequate for the present purpose, the anthropic principle prescribes that the probability of finding oneself on a particular animate world line on a single strand within a small time interval is proportional to […] the “anthropic quotient”.
>
>In the CAE (classical anthropic Everett) model set up in this way, the meaning of the weighting fraction p of a channel constituted by an ensemble of very similar single-world strands is now clear. It does not directly determine the total probability of finding oneself in that channel, but it does determine the probability of finding oneself within a time interval on a world line of a particular kind.


### Commentary

>Although the interpretations – and perhaps the ethical implications – are different, there is no effectively observable distinction between what is predicted by the deterministic many-world CAE model presented here (in which only one’s identity is unforeseeable) and what is predicted by the corresponding classical model of the ordinary single-world type (in which the material physical outcome depends on chance). It might therefore be argued that the traditional single-world model should be preferred on the grounds that it is simpler, or less ontologically “bloated”. It is however to be recalled that a classical model cannot claim to represent ultimate reality, but merely provides what is at best an approximation to a more accurately realistic quantum model, a purpose for which the traditional single world-model is not so satisfactory.
>
>Another point to be emphasised is that the ontology in question involves only mental feelings and perceptions. As foretold by Berkeley, but contrary to what used to be taught by “positivists” such as Mach, matter, as incorporated in physical fields over spacetime, should not be considered to have objective “reality”, but has the status merely of mathematical machinery (that might be replaced for predictive purposes by an equivalent action at a distance formulation based on Green functions).
>
>Having recognised that the relevant ontology does not involve matter but only mind, one is still free to entertain different opinions about how extensive or “bloated” (Leslie 1983) it may be. The anthropic measure characterised […] merely determines the relative probability of the perceptions in question, but but not the absolute number of times they occur. If ontological economy is a desideratum, it might seem preferable to postulate the actual occurrence only of a fraction of the perceptions admitted by the theory. On the other hand for those concerned with economy only in the sense of Ockham’s razor, and particularly for those who are unhappy with the concept of probability except when it can be prescribed in terms of relative frequencies, the most attractive possibility would presumably be to suppose that all the perceptions admitted by the theory actually occur (in the indicated proportions). Although it is more ontologically extravagant, the latter alternative has the advantage of conforming to the requirement that was expressed in metaphorical language by Einstein’s edict that “God does not play dice”. However that is not for us mere mortals to judge: as far as scientific observation is concerned there is no way of telling the difference.
