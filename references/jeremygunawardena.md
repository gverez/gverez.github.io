## A Complex Hierarchy of Avoidance Behaviors in a Single-Cell Eukaryote <a name="arkhe"></a>
*With Joseph Dexter and Sudhakaran Prabakaran, Current Biology vol. 29, pp. 1-7, 2019*

### Summary [p. 1]

>Complex behavior is associated with animals with nervous systems, but decision-making and learning also occur in non-neural organisms, including singly nucleated cells and multinucleate synctia. Ciliates are single-cell eukaryotes, widely dispersed in aquatic habitats, with an extensive behavioral repertoire. In 1906, Herbert Spencer Jennings described in the sessile ciliate Stentor roeseli a hierarchy of responses to repeated stimulation, which are among the most complex behaviors reported for a singly nucleated cell. These results attracted widespread interest and exert continuing fascination but were discredited during the behaviorist orthodoxy by claims of non-reproducibility [23]. These claims were based on experiments with the motile ciliate Stentor coeruleus. We acquired and maintained the correct organism in laboratory culture and used micromanipulation and video microscopy to confirm Jennings’ observations. Despite significant individual variation, not addressed by Jennings, S. roeseli exhibits avoidance behaviors in a characteristic hierarchy of bending, ciliary alteration, contractions, and detachment, which is distinct from habituation or conditioning. Remarkably, the choice of contraction versus detachment is consistent with a fair coin toss. Such behavioral complexity may have had an evolutionary advantage in protist ecosystems, and the ciliate cortex may have provided mechanisms for implementing such behavior prior to the emergence of multicellularity. Our work resurrects Jennings’ pioneering insights and adds to the list of exceptional features, including regeneration, genome rearrangement, codon reassignment, and cortical inheritance, for which the ciliate clade is renowned.


### Experimental setup [p. 1]

>Ciliates form a clade of single-cell eukaryotes characterized by their eponymous cilia, nuclear dimorphism, and sexual conjugation. S. roeseli is colorless, trumpet shaped, and visible to the naked eye. Ciliary rows along the axis and ciliary spirals at the wider end generate a fluid vortex to bring food particles to the ‘‘mouth.’’ S. roeseli is typically sessile, anchoring itself to algal detritus with a holdfast of secreted mucus. […]

>Organisms were placed in a droplet on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped for video recording. Beads were delivered through a microinjection needle, which we positioned near the organism while observing through the microscope. Pulses of stimulation were generated by opening and closing a stopcock on a gravity-fed system.

### Behavior identification [p. 2]

>Jennings reported a hierarchy of behaviors – resting (R), bending away (B), ciliary alteration (A), contraction (C), and detachment from the holdfast (D) – in response to repeated stimulation. […] We found these same behaviors repeatedly in experiments conducted over several months.

### Behavior hierarchy [p. 2]

>Pulses of stimulation were not administered in a fixed sequence. Instead, pulsing was adapted to each organism during observation. With this protocol, it is difficult to attribute an individual behavior to an individual pulse. The decision to administer a pulse depended on whether the organism appeared to have returned to a resting state; had we waited longer, we cannot rule out that it might have responded again. Accordingly, we interpret the behavior sequences as arising from a generalized ‘‘stimulation’’ and focus on the pattern of observed behaviors, A, B, C, and D, and not on the pattern of pulses. […]
>
>We conclude that a behavior hierarchy is strongly supported statistically.


### Evidence for complex decision-making [p. 3]

>We consider the behavior hierarchy as a form of sequential decision-making, in the sense that, when given similar stimulation repeatedly, the organism ‘‘changes its mind’’ about which response to give, thereby following the observed hierarchy. Cellular decision-making has been widely discussed, but this form of it is simpler than heritable phenotypic change or adaptive choice when confronting multiple stimulations. […]
>
>If the organism is making internal decisions, the heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine its overall decision strategy. Staddon has examined several potential strategies to explain Jennings’ observations but without replicating the experiments or addressing the heterogeneity. We considered the proportion of organisms that remain attached after a given number of contractions. The resulting curve is well fitted (R² = 0:98) to an exponential decline with rate 0.689. An exponential decline is consistent with each individual organism following the memory-less (Markov) process, in which an organism transitions between resting and contraction, with the possibility of detachment after contraction (as noted above, no organism detached without contracting first). Detachment is represented as an absorbing exit state. […] Hence, in so far as the decision between contracting and detaching is concerned, the data are consistent with each organism independently flipping an unbiased coin at each decision, irrespective of previous decisions.

### Summary and conclusions [p. 4]

>Non-associative learning, such as habituation, is well established in single cells. Suggestions that ciliates also exhibited associative learning, either classical or instrumental, encountered repeated failures of reproducibility, leading to a consensus against such behavior. […]
>
>Remarkably, the choice between contraction and detachment is consistent with a fair coin toss, raising the intriguing question as to how S. roeseli implements this so accurately at a molecular level.
>
>We can only speculate on the evolutionary forces that led to the emergence of such complex behavior. Several ciliate species have multiple mating types, suggesting the need for powerful social recognition mechanisms. S. coeruleus has binary mating, but the mating behavior of S. roeseli is not known. It is, however, a voracious predator, able to devour unwary rotifers, which have a thousand cells and a nervous system. A behavior hierarchy could have been an efficient strategy to avoid the costly process of detachment and relocation, once a rich hunting ground had been located. As to why the decision between contraction and detachment appears to be perfectly random, perhaps the answer lies in some form of game-theoretic optimization arising from this ecological context.

>The ciliate membrane and cytoskeletal cortex are the most likely candidates for mechanistically implementing the behaviors observed here. […] The ciliate membrane is excitable. It harbors voltage-dependent and mechanosensitive ion channels that generate action potentials, analogous to those in neurons, and these channels play a key role in habituation. The cortex can propagate to daughter cells, in a non-genetic and Lamarckian manner, micro-surgical alterations to ciliary geometry, giving rise thereby to ‘‘cortical inheritance’’. […] The cortex also plays the central role in regeneration: excised fragments of a ciliate, provided they contain appropriate parts of the cortex, will reconstruct themselves into smaller, whole organisms. With such extravagant capabilities for self-organization at its disposal, S. roeseli’s avoidance hierarchy may begin to seem less extraordinary. […]

>Jennings’ experiments on Stentor were evidence for agency – the capacity for cellular decision-making – in contrast to Loeb’s insistence that life was merely physical chemistry. Loeb is celebrated for inspiring behaviorism and anticipating the success of molecular reductionism. Jennings is sometimes unfairly associated with the wooly holism of some of his admirers. Yet his ciliates continue to haunt the same debate, now couched in different language. Kirschner, Gerhart, and Mitchison mischievously refer to it as the problem of ‘‘molecular vitalism’’ and remind us of the challenge to molecular understanding presented by ciliate cortical inheritance and regeneration. There has been important progress here: the genome of S. coeruleus has been sequenced and molecular insights acquired into ciliary patterning and regeneration. Jennings’ avoidance hierarchy presents the same challenge as self-organization. It reveals unexpected depths in the cognitive capabilities of singly nucleated cells. We should explore these more broadly in their natural context and unravel their molecular underpinnings. Nobody would be more delighted by such molecular vitalism than Jennings himself.

>Organisms like S. roeselii were apex predators prior to multicellular life, and they are extremely widespread in many different aquatic environments. They have to be “clever” at figuring out what to avoid, where to eat and all the other things that organisms have to do to live. I think it’s clear that they can have complex ways of doing so.
>
>They do the simple things first, but if you keep stimulating, they “decide” to try something else. S. roeselii has no brain, but there seems to be some mechanism that, in effect, lets it “change its mind” once it feels like the irritation has gone on too long. This hierarchy gives a vivid sense of some form of relatively complex, decision-making calculation going on inside the organism, weighing whether it’s better to execute one behavior versus another.
>
>It’s somehow basing its decisions, at the molecular level, on a fair coin toss. I can’t think of any known mechanism that would allow them to implement this. It’s incredibly fascinating and something Jennings never observed because we needed quantitative measurements to reveal it.
>
>In developmental biology or cancer research, for example, the processes cells undergo are often referred to as programs, suggesting that cells are “programmed” to do what they do. But cells exist in a very complex ecosystem, and they are, in a way, talking and negotiating with each other, responding to signals and making decisions. I think this experiment forces us to think about the existence of, very speculatively, some form of cellular “cognition,” in which single cells can be capable of complex information processing and decision-making in response. All life has the same underpinnings, and our results give us at least one piece of evidence for why we should be broadening our view to include this kind of thinking in modern biology research.
