## The causal quantum theory program <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### The received wisdom [p. 2]

>Today it is generally assumed that the success of quantum mechanics demands that we accept a world view in which physical processes at the most fundamental level are seen as being irreducibly and ineliminably indeterministic. That is, one of the great watersheds in twentieth-century scientific thought is the “Copenhagen” insight that empirical evidence and logic are seen as necessarily implying an indeterministic picture of nature. This is in marked contrast to any classical representation of a clockwork universe. […]
>
>In Niels Bohr’s early analyses of quantum theory, around the time of his seminal 1927 Como lecture, we read:
>
>>“In contrast to ordinary mechanics, the new quantum mechanics does not deal with a space-time description of the motion of atomic particles.… The difficulties [in constructing pictures of interactions between atoms and radiation] seem to require just that renunciation of mechanical models in space and time which is so characteristic a feature in the new quantum mechanics…. [The quantum] postulate implies a renunciation as regards the causal space-time co-ordination of atomic processes.” […]
>
>Werner Heisenberg, in his retrospective recollections of these early days, tells us that:
>
>>“It should be emphasized, however, that the probability function does not in itself represent a course of events in the course of time. It represents a tendency for events and our knowledge of events. The probability function can be connected with reality only if one essential condition is fulfilled: if a new measurement is made to determine a certain property of the system…. [T]here is no orbit in the ordinary sense…. [T]he idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them... is impossible.”
>
>And Max Born weighs in with his own views on the role of causality in physics:
>
>>“[I]n quantum theory it is the principle of causality, or more accurately that of determinism, which must be dropped and replaced by something else…. We now have a new form of the law of causality…. It is as follows: if in a certain process the initial conditions are determined as accurately as the uncertainty relations permit, then the probabilities of all possible subsequent states are governed by exact laws…. [N]o concealed parameters can be introduced with the help of which the indeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic one. Hence if a future theory should be deterministic, it cannot be a modification of the present one but must be essentially different. How this could be possible without sacrificing a whole treasure of well established results I leave to the determinists to worry about.”
>
>Support for similar beliefs can also be found in John von Neumann’s work, while Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger remained incredulous at such certitude on these matters. These positions that I have attributed to Bohr, Heisenberg and Born are not merely the products of a bygone era, but are echoed in modern textbooks on quantum mechanics. As just one example of many that could be cited:
>
>>“It is clear that [the result of the double-slit experiment] can in no way be reconciled with the idea that electrons move in paths…. In quantum mechanics there is no such concept as the path of a particle.” (Landau and Lifshitz 1958).
>
>We can characterize these central conceptual commitments of standard versions of quantum mechanics as:
>
>- No description of quantum phenomena is possible in terms of particle trajectories in a space-time background.
>- Probability enters into quantum theory in an ineliminable and essentially nonclassical way (i.e., probabilities cannot be merely epistemic).
>- It is in principle impossible to give a deterministic account of quantum phenomena (at the level of the events or observables themselves).
>
>Of course, John Bell very effectively reminded us that it was Bohm’s 1952 theory that gave lie to all of these beliefs by explicitly doing the impossible.
>
>In order to generate some conceptual space for the argument of the next section, let me parse a scientific theory into two distinct components: its formalism and its interpretation. These are logically separable, even if they are often entangles in practice. Here a formalism means a set of equations and a set of calculational rules for making predictions that can be compared with experiment. Both standard quantum mechanics and Bohm’s version use the same set of rules for predicting the values of the observables. The (physical) interpretation refers to what the theory tells us about the underlying structure of these phenomena (i.e., a corresponding story about the furniture of the world – an ontology). Hence, one formalism with two different interpretations counts as two different theories.


### Bohm’s theory and typical criticism of it [p. 4]

>Since the formalism of quantum mechanics is not identical with, and need not include, the Copenhagen interpretation, there exists the possibility of an alternative, observationally equivalent theory based on that formalism. In a sense, David Bohm’s 1952 work can be seen as an exercise in logic – proving that Copenhagen dogma was not the only logical possibility compatible with the facts. Bohm accepted the formalism of quantum mechanics and showed that more microstructure is consistent with it than had previously been appreciated. The usual calculational rules of standard quantum mechanics still give average values for observed quantities, but now there are actual particles and trajectories. […]
>
>This system of Bohmian mechanics (BM) is completely deterministic in the sense that precise specification of the initial position (or "hidden variable") of a particle uniquely determines its future behavior. Because a quantum potential is present in addition to the usual classical potential, these are very sensitive to the initial positions of the particles. There is a certain benign nonlocality that produces the usual observed quantum effects. The Heisenberg uncertainty relations state practical limitations on the accuracy with which we can know simultaneously the values of certain pairs of variables. One of the most beautiful aspects of Bohm's paper is his treatment of the measurement problem (which now becomes a non-problem). There is no collapse of the wave function and, hence, no measurement problem. The basic idea is that a particle always has a definite position between measurements. There is no superposition of properties and "measurement" (or observation) is an attempt to discover this actual position.
>
>One would also expect no particular conceptual problem in obtaining the classical equations of motion from those of Bohm's theory since the basic exact dynamical equation already has the general form of Newton's second law. This intuition is essentially correct since, loosely speaking, when the quantum potential is negligible, then the dynamical law becomes just the classical equation of motion. Here we have a logically consistent and empirically adequate deterministic theory of quantum phenomena. […]
>
>The simple truth is that Bohm's theory offers us an empirically adequate, conceptually different view of physical phenomena in which there is an objective reality whose existence does not depend upon an observer. Whether this is better or worse than the traditional view of quantum phenomena is a matter that must be decided on the basis of criteria other than empirical adequacy and logical consistency alone. That is, this alternative approach to quantum theory is a perfectly viable one even today. The purpose of many of the essays in this volume is to examine the implications of this theory. Once one appreciates that Bohm's theory cannot simply be dismissed out of hand, some seven decades after the formulation and general acceptance of the Copenhagen version of quantum mechanics, one can then ask the relevant historical and sociological question of how the standard (or Copenhagen) theory established its hegemony.


### Whence the Copenhagen hegemony [p. 7]

>As early as the mid 1920s, before any coherent quantum mechanics had even been formulated, there already existed an alternative causal quantum theory program in which fundamental physical processes were seen as being irreducibly and ineliminably absolutely deterministic. One can readily trace the origins and eventual fate of this program. My story begins with Louis de Broglie's theory of phase waves, includes various hydrodynamical and velocity-field (essentially "hidden variables") interpretations, such as those due to Erwin Madelung and to Einstein, progresses through de Broglie's theory of the double solution and his (provisional) pilot-wave model, the encounters with the Copenhagen group at the 1927 Solvay Congress, the impact of von Neumann's "impossibility" proof, Bohm's 1952 paper, and subsequent work on stochastic mechanics as a basis for the Schrödinger equation. Today we often see as either specious or at least far from logically compelling many of the arguments that were taken as decisive in an earlier era (such as Heisenberg's, Bohr's and Born's opinions cited earlier in this essay – opinions that soon became transmuted into inviolable dogma – about the impossibility of a picturable and causal quantum theory in a space-time background, Pauli's "refutation" of de Broglie's 1927 pilot-wave model, von Neumann's "proof" of the impossibility of hidden variables in quantum mechanics, Einstein's belief that even the type of nonlocality implied by quantum mechanics could make impossible doing science as we have known it and the apparent "conflict" between quantum nonlocality and relativity). […]
>
>By the late nineteenth century there were significant (although by no means dominant) philosophical precedents for the concept of indeterminism in nature, as opposed to the straightforward determinism often associated with classical physics. For example, the causality principle for physical processes and the Kantian doctrine that acceptance of causality was a precondition for human understanding were challenged. Contingency and inherent chance in nature's actions were suggested. Such thinking opposed belief in a completely rational universe and proposed instead an element of irrationality in a nature having contingent laws. In a given situation, there would be equally possible alternatives to what does, in fact, occur. These concepts became important elements in the philosophy of Harald Høffding, to whom I shall return shortly.
>
>For individuals who are key to generating and promulgating new theoretical structures, personal, or psychological, factors can be important for the origin of central concepts. The divergent views of Einstein and of Bohr in their debate over quantum mechanics can be seen as rooted in their different styles of thinking (images versus words, respectively), rather than in broad cultural forces that were common to both (Kaiser 1994). As an illustration of these types of influences, consider that of Høffding's philosophy on Bohr's formulation and interpretation of quantum mechanics. In 1966, an influential history of quantum physics sketched the philosophical currents present when quantum theory was formulated in the first quarter of this century (e.g., those I referred to in the preceding paragraph) and intimated a significant influence of Høffding's teaching on Bohr's own work in the foundations of quantum mechanics (Jammer 1989). Subsequent research has substantiated the impact of Høffding's philosophy on Bohr (Faye 1991). Not only did Bohr attend Høffding's lectures as a student, but he also read his works and corresponded with him later in life. One of Høffding's tenets was that in life decisive events proceed through sudden "jerks" or discontinuities. Bohr explicitly acknowledged the influence of Høffding's philosophy on his own formulation of complementarity. […]
>
>So far I have concentrated on forces tending to produce consensus on what would become the orthodox view. On the other hand, what was to become the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics certainly had its worthy opponents (e.g., Einstein, de Broglie, Schrödinger). However, the main thing that the latter had in common was their dislike of Copenhagen, without offering a fully formulated alternative to it (except de Broglie who suffered badly at Pauli's hands at the 1927 Solvay Congress). By contrast, the Copenhagen group, while they did have significant differences among themselves on interpretative issues, presented a united front on the theory as a whole. Even more important, they had the talent, organization and drive to fashion a working theory that proved to be phenomenally successful calculationally. Most working scientists really care mainly about that and are willing to leave the "philosophical" issues aside – or even to accept without deep reflection a certain amount of metaphysical baggage. […]
>
>If the final decision between two theories were a wholly rational one, independent of these prior metaphysical commitments and of sociological factors (and this is by no means obvious in the case of quantum mechanics), then the origins of and reasons for those commitments, while perhaps interesting in themselves, would actually be irrelevant for the ultimate theory choice and for its "logical" justification. This is just the usual distinction between the logic of discovery and the logic of justification. However, while empirical evidence is essential for rejecting incorrect theories and for suggesting new avenues of speculation and of research, it is by itself insufficient to account fully for the choice in favor of one of these competing interpretations of quantum mechanics over the other. It is precisely because of this fact that we have had to consider broader factors as well.
>
>By the mid-1930s, the option of a causal quantum theory program had generally been rejected as logically impossible and necessarily empirically inadequate when, in fact, it need not have been taken to be either. What the general conceptual arguments of Bohr and his school really constitute are consistency arguments for, rather than proofs of, a possible representation of microphenomena. We might say that the Copenhagen interpretation defined itself as true and strengthened its hold on physics, rewriting history so that Einstein, de Broglie and Schrödinger largely fade from view, thus leaving Copenhagen as the only intelligible version of quantum mechanics (Heilbron 1988).

### The reception of Bohm’s theory [p. 14]

>Pauli had been one of the harshest critics of de Broglie's pilot-wave theory (of which Bohm's is a lineal descendant) at the 1927 Solvay Congress and he maintained the same attitude toward Bohm's theory. Interestingly enough, when Bohm sent him a copy of the paper in which Bohm showed Pauli's objections to the causal interpretation to be specious, Pauli never responded. In a letter to Born in 1953, Pauli referred to what he considered to be the retrograde efforts by Schrödinger, Bohm and Einstein and confidently predicted that the statistical character of the wave function and of the laws of nature would determine the style of the laws of physics for centuries to come. Any dream of a way back to the classical style of Newton and Maxwell seemed to him both hopeless and in bad taste. An extensive study of the correspondence between Pauli and the theoretical physicist Markus Fierz reveals that Pauli's interest in the philosophical possibilities opened up by uncertainty was one reason for his opposition to Bohm's attempt (and to hidden-variables theories generally) (Laurikainen 1988). Pauli worried that these ill-conceived efforts might, for ideological reasons, divert younger scientists from more fruitful (orthodox) avenues of research. His letter to Fierz in 1952 was quite sarcastic and contemptuous of Bohm's work. Fierz has offered the view that de Broglie was a Catholic and Bohm a Communist and that, to Pauli, this was the black and red alliance. Pauli, so Fierz claims, felt that the de Broglie-Bohm theory was either prattle or an unnatural way of stating the same thing as standard quantum theory. Both Pauli and Fierz expressed strong, negative opinions in emotionally charged terms. For Pauli more was at stake that just physics.

>Whereas materialism considers the spiritual as a mere byproduct of the material, Pauli especially understood the "epistemological lesson" of atomic physics as a signpost pointing in another direction. He, like Heisenberg, thought that quantum theory had clearly shown materialism to be unsatisfactory. Pauli was quite explicit in holding that it is wrong to imagine the existence of the material external world without including the observer and his psyche in that world view. The ideas of a detached observer and of realism were to be abandoned. He saw the Copenhagen interpretation as not being compatible with a materialistic world view. On the downside for the causal program from Pauli's perspective was the fact that psychological problems associated with observations were quite neglected by Bohm, as were the unconscious in his causal-deterministic universe. As a result, Pauli felt, Bohm saw no quantum paradoxes, but at the price of no free will either. He wanted no part of a deterministic, clock-work universe and believed that the trend of Western culture since the seventeenth century had been dangerous. The "irrational influences" that statistical causality implied were important for him. Pauli's concerns spilled over into the theological realm as well.
>
>There were deep philosophical, moral and religious issues involved here. An attack on the canonical version of quantum theory resonated quite negatively and strongly with Pauli's beliefs about God and his views on epistemology. It was inconceivable to him that anything like a return to a "classical" world with causality and picturable, continuous processes in space-time was either possible or anything less than a disgusting loss of nerve and a return to darkness (Laurikainen 1988). Partly because of ideological struggles involving scientists within the Soviet Union and partly because of Bohm's persecution by Senator Joseph McCarthy's crusade against un-American activities, Marxism and Communism also came to be associated with Bohm's interpretation by the early 1950s and that was certainly not conducive to an objective examination of his theory.
>
>Even though in 1952 Bohm dispatched Pauli's specious earlier (1927) objection to a pilot-wave model and in 1964 Bell (inspired largely by Bohm's own 1952 model) did the same for von Neumann's celebrated "proof' of the impossibility of hidden-variables theories, the issue of the Copenhagen versus a causal interpretation remained effectively settled.

### Alternative approaches – a renewed interest [p. 17]

>Probably the most dramatic interpretation of the standard formalism off quantum mechanics, and one of the oldest, is that of relative states, often termed many-worlds (Everett 1957; De Witt and Graham 1973). It avoids any problem of collapse by taking the unitary Schrödinger evolution of the state vector to be the complete description of the unfolding of the universe (which, on some readings, now contains many worlds). Aside from the profligacy of any literal interpretation of its ontology, it remains to be seen how this interpretation can adequately account for the observed quantum-mechanical statistics within any one branch of the universe (Albert and Loewer 1988; Kent 1990). There is a more recent variation on this theme, the many-minds interpretation (Albert and Loewer 1988; 1991; Albert 1992), that avoids this particular difficulty of Everett's theory. […]

>As part of this general rekindling of interest in the foundational interpretive problems of quantum mechanics, the last decade has seen renewed work on Bohm's program – among both theoretical physicists and philosophers of science concerned with finding a conceptually coherent framework within which to analyze and understand quantum phenomena. One of the great appeals of Bohm's theory is that it presents a definite, complete and functioning dynamics that can be studied in detail. Recent activities in Bohmian mechanics include a critical assessment of the roles of nonlocality and of probability in this theory, a clarification of its conceptual and mathematical framework and of the ramifications it has for our interpretation of the constraints provided by relativity, use of its graphic and realistic ontology to generate illustrative examples of great pedagogical value, technical applications of the theory in the relativistic domain, in field theory and in gravitation, and a reconsideration of the quantum mechanics of time measurements. There would be little point in my reviewing this work in any detail here since the majority of the essays in the present volume are devoted to developing and criticizing these and other aspects of this evolving theory. The reader will soon become aware from these papers that there are strong differences of opinion and even disagreements on technical matters among some of the proponents about various ways of fleshing out Bohm's general ideas. Rather than viewing this with alarm, I suggest that this is a sign of health in an area of growth and activity. This is not a body of dogma that brooks no dissent. David Bohm's seminal views on and his considerable technical contributions to quantum theory are finally receiving the long-overdue scrutiny they deserve to see whether or not they will prove to be consistent, empirically adequate and fruitful for further avenues of research.
