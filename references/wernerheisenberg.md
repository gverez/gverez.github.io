### Introduction by David Lindley [p. viii]

>In what became known as the old quantum theory, originating with Niels Bohr in 1913, atoms were pictured as little solar systems. Electrons orbited the small, massive nucleus strictly according to the principles of Newtonian mechanics. The quantum principle came into this model with the additional restriction that only certain orbits, out of the infinite range possible, were in fact permitted. When an electron jumped between orbits, the atom either took in or gave out a quantum of electromagnetic energy – later dubbed a photon – corresponding to the energy difference between the orbits. This mechanism explained why atoms, as had been known for decades, had characteristic spectroscopic signatures, emitting and absorbing light only at certain fixed frequencies.
>
>By the early 1920s, the old quantum theory, developed particularly by Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, had become overelaborate and unwieldy, and at the same time failed to explain numerous subtleties of atomic spectra. It seemed possible that electrons in atoms moved according to rules fundamentally different from classical mechanics. Werner Heisenberg, then an undergraduate student with Sommerfeld in Munich, came to know this crisis intimately, and it was he, in 1925, who came up with its strange and startling resolution. “The idea suggested itself,” he tells us here, “that one should write down the mechanical laws not as equations for the positions and velocities of the electrons, but as equations for the frequencies and amplitudes of their Fourier expansion.”
>
>This coy statement warrants a little amplification. The idea Heisenberg refers to was, to be clear, his and his alone. Just as Einstein, in fashioning relativity, redefined what we mean by space and time, so Heisenberg in 1925 forced a similarly profound reevaluation of the heretofore self-evident concepts of position and velocity.
>
>A Fourier series is the standard mathematical device by which any vibration of a violin string, for example, can be represented as a suitable combination of the string’s elementary tones. In such a representation, the instantaneous position and velocity of any point along the string is expressed in terms of some weighted sum of the string’s fundamental and harmonic notes. Heisenberg’s stroke of genius was to apply this same logic to the motion of electrons in atoms. Rather than thinking about the position and velocity of an electron as its primitive, defining characteristics, he wrote down expressions representing position and velocity indirectly, as composites of the atom’s elementary vibrations – that is, its characteristic spectroscopic frequencies.
>
>This was, to put it mildly, an odd thing to do. Substituting his new definitions of position and velocity into the standard laws of mechanics, however, Heisenberg made the astonishing discovery that he could derive, in a wholly new way, a law of quantization. His equations gave sensible answers only when the energy of the electron took on one of a restricted set of values. Heisenberg, as he is too modest to say directly in these essays, had discovered the germ of quantum mechanics.
>
>Remarkably, as Paul Dirac and Pascual Jordan later established systematically, the laws of classical mechanics passed over wholly unchanged into the new system of quantum mechanics. What changed were the quantities – the seemingly basic elements of mechanics, such as a particle’s position and velocity – that those laws govern.
>
>And this is where the trouble begins. Two years later, in his celebrated Uncertainty Principle, Heisenberg went on to prove that in quantum mechanics position and velocity do not possess the straightforward, unambiguous meaning that they enjoy in classical mechanics. Rather than being elementary properties of some particle, position and velocity become in a sense secondary characteristics that the experimenter must derive from some quantum system by making a suitable measurement. And measurement is not the simple act it used to be. The better you measure the position of a particle, the less you can find out its velocity and vice versa: In such terms the Uncertainty Principle is often expressed. A more careful statement, however, is that quantum particles have no intrinsic properties that neatly correspond to position and velocity, and that measurement forces a quantum system to cough up values for these quantities in a way that depends on how the measurement is done.
>
>Even to think, in fact, of a quantum particle is misleading, because the concept labeled “particle” has connotations that no longer fully apply. Just a few months after Heisenberg formulated his version of quantum mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger came up with the equation that bears his name, which offers a different imagery. In the Schrödinger picture, an electron belonging to an atom takes the form of a spread-out stationary wave – a wave that represents the probability, roughly speaking, of an electron being found in this place or that around the nucleus.
>
>Is an electron a wave or a particle? The answer, as Heisenberg insists in these essays, is that the words “wave” and “particle” are formalized in classical mechanics by derivation from our everyday experience, and by definition are mutually exclusive. A wave can’t be a particle and particle can’t be a wave. A quantum object, in itself, is neither one thing nor the other. If you decide to measure a wave-like property (wavelength, for instance, in a diffraction or interference experiment), the thing you are observing will look like a wave. Measure a particle property (position or velocity), on the other hand, and you will see particle-like behavior.
>
>Accepting the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics, Heisenberg declared that “quantum mechanics… arose… from the endeavor to expand Bohr’s principle of correspondence to a complete mathematical scheme by refining his assertions.” This also is excessively modest. Guided though he may have been by Bohr’s correspondence principle – the idea, loosely speaking, that quantum systems have to pass over to classical behavior and appearance on the macroscopic scale – the spark of originality that led to quantum mechanics was purely Heisenberg’s. But in late 1926 and early 1927, Heisenberg and Bohr worked closely together in Copenhagen – or clashed heads, rather – and it was this intense exchange that produced both the Uncertainty Principle and the so-called Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that Bohr subsequently did so much to promote. Heisenberg did not instantly accede to Bohr’s views, but by the time of his Nobel lecture, and certainly when he gave these lectures, he was wholeheartedly in the Copenhagen camp, and credits Bohr for many of the principles he espouses. […]
>
>In stressing the inadequacy of either the wave or the particle picture alone, Heisenberg tells us that “by playing with both pictures, by going from one picture to the other and back again, we finally get the right impression of the strange kind of reality behind our atomic experiments.” This, I fear, will strike a good many readers as a bit of a doge. That’s all very well, Professor Heisenberg, these readers might say, but can you spell out for us just what this “strange kind of reality” consists of? Alas, that is ultimately what we cannot do, at least no in a very satisfactory way.
>
>The Copenhagen strategy for dealing with this impasse is to continue using the old language – waves and particles, positions and velocities – but on the strict understanding that the concepts embodied in these words are no longer primary, but come to use only through agency of observation and measurement. Thus arises the popularly stated notion that in quantum mechanics, the act of measurement defines the thing being measured, or that the thing measured and the thing doing the measuring are inextricably intertwined.
>
>It may seem, as a corollary, that our knowledge of the world has thus become arbitrary and subjective in a way that classically it was not. If we get different information depending on what sorts of measurements we make, and if we can choose freely to make one set of measurements or another, should we conclude that the world of hard facts, as Dickens’s Mr. Gradgrind might have put it, has been obliterated? That the way the world appears depends in almost a whimsical manner on the way we choose to look?
>
>Heisenberg argues strenuously against any such inference. A measurement, he says, is a specific and concrete act, yielding a definite piece of information. And it has always been true that the world revealed to us by science depends on the kind of information we are capable of finding out. “We have to remember,” Heisenberg says, “that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”
>
>Here again the ready may well feel a sense of unease, that the answer won’t quite do. Classically, the world is supposed to be some set of facts. The more minutely we observe, the more of those facts we are able to gather. In quantum mechanics, thought, the new and awkward problem is that learning one kind fact about the world will very often preclude forever our knowing some other kind fact. Is there truly a solid foundation, then, to the world of objective data and measured information that we seem to inhabit?
>
>The Copenhagen response is to insist that asking such a question is essentially asking for a classical account of the quantum world, which by definition can’t be done. But this doesn’t tell us how we should think instead. By way of addressing this conundrum – how to we describe a state of affairs when we admit at the outset we don’t have the language to do it? - Heisenberg embarks on a philosophical tour that starts with the Greeks and brings us through to Kant. That he would do this at all sets Heisenberg apart from most modern physicists, who generally disdain or simply ignore philosophical thinking about their subject. But Heisenberg was educated in Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century, and had a professor of classics for his father. Being reasonably well versed in philosophy was, for Heisenberg, merely an aspect of a good general education.
>
>Heisenberg puts great emphasis on the distinction Descartes made between mind and matter, which is at the core of the classical belief in an objective reality – a material world, that is, existing independently and awaiting our impartial scrutiny. That conceit may indeed have been central to the rise of classical physics, but we should not on that account take it as unquestionable or self-evidently true. Aristotle, for example, conceived of a tangible matter as the imposition of form on a “potentia,” a sort of universal essence comprising possibility rather than actuality. By no means does Heisenberg wish to suggest that Aristotle somehow anticipated Schrödinger’s wave function. He is making the useful point that our modern notions about reality and matter, straightforward though they might seem, were not always obvious, and came about through profound intellectual struggle. […]
>
>The changes demanded by relativity were not so dramatic and unpalatable as they had first seemed – chiefly because relativity did not deny the validity of “hard realism,” as Heisenberg calls it. Two observers may seem some sequence of events in a different order, for example, but there is no denying that the events really occurred, and the point of relativity is precisely that it provides a rational way for these observes to understand why they have not seen the same chronology.
>
>With quantum mechanics, by contrast, classical assumptions have been shattered but no very satisfactory account has been put in their place. Seen in this perspective, the Copenhagen interpretation is best regarded as a workmanlike system that allows the physicist to deal practically with the theory while cordoning off certain questions as being fundamentally unanswerable. Not surprisingly, this strategy has provoked opposition. Heisenberg’s discussion of criticisms of the Copenhagen interpretation is the most dated chapter here, because many of the criticisms have long since faded away. Two notable ideas linger, however.
>
>In the early 1950s, not long before Heisenberg delivered these lectures, David Bohm came up with a way of recasting quantum mechanics so that it supported, he claimed, a more conventional philosophy while not losing any of its empirical success. According to Bohm, a particle’s properties include “hidden variables,” inaccessible to the observer, that determine the outcome of measurements. The seeming unpredictability of quantum events then arises from our ignorance of these hidden variables. Superficially, this makes quantum mechanics look more like the classical mechanics of atoms in a gas, where we can make statistical predictions about the behavior of the gas as a whole, even though we cannot know what every individual atom is doing. Conceptually, however, there is a huge difference. In classical mechanics, we can think of doing ever more ingenious experiments to pin down more precisely the atom’s properties. In Bohmian mechanics, which still attracts an earnest band of supporters, the information carried by the hidden variables is strictly off limits – as it must be, in fact, if the outward manifestations of quantum mechanics are to remain unchanged.
>
>Heisenberg offers a variety of cogent reasons why Bohmian mechanics is not as appealing as it might seem, but his basic attitude is that the hidden variables approach buys an elusive and partial return to classical realism at the cost of destroying much of the mathematical elegance and symmetry of quantum mechanics in its pure form. In a word, Bohmian mechanics is ugly.
>
>Opposition to the Copenhagen view also came, as is well known, from Einstein, a lifelong subscriber to “hard realism.” In 1935, with his young colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he published the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen paper, setting out what its authors regarded as a demonstrable flaw, in fact a paradox, in quantum mechanics. The EPR analysis asks us to think about two particles originating in some event, so that some of their fundamental properties are interlinked, then flying away from each other. An experimenter who measures a certain property of one of the particles immediately knows the corresponding property of the other. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that because this arrangement allows the physicist to obtain knowledge about a particle without performing any direct observation on it, then the particle’s properties must be intrinsic to it – fixed in advance, that is, as classical thinking dictates, and not indeterminate, as quantum mechanics would have it.
>
>For many years it seemed that the point EPR raised was at best a metaphysical observation. A decade after these Gifford lectures, however, the physicist John Bell devised an ingenious way to turn the EPR analysis into a practical, if difficult, laboratory test. If particles really had, prior to measurement, definite but unknown properties rather than the indefinite attributes implied by quantum mechanics, then an experiemtn of the type Bell proposed would give results different from the quantum mechanical prediction. Only after Heisenberg’s death in 1976 were such experiments finally performed, with results that confirmed quantum mechanics and repudiated EPR’s viewpoint. The lesson, as Heisenberg had already indicated in his discussion of Einstein’s views, is that quantum mechanical reality is not like classical reality, whether Einstein liked it or not.
>
>The standard interpretation of quantum mechanics survives, therefore, and Heisenberg’s elegant presentation retains its value and force. But the story is not yet over.
>
>The Copenhagen strategy words perfectly well for experimenters in their laboratories, even for astrophysicists studying the structure of stars and galaxies, because in these cases there is never any serious confusion about what part must be treated quantum mechanically and what part classically. But when we enlarge our scope to include the entire universe, that distinction cannot be maintained. The universe started with a big bang, a brief, dense chaos of elementary particles furiously interacting – a quintessentially quantum mechanical state of affairs. As the universe thereafter expanded and cooled, structures began to emerge – first matter itself, then aggregations of matters in the form of the earliest stars, and so on until we arrive at the cosmos in its present state. In this evolution, an objectively real collection of galaxies, stars, and planets somehow emerged from the indeterminate quantum fog, but it did so without the agency of an external measurer or observer, because the universe is everything that there is.
>
>Because the Copenhagen viewpoint relies on a distinction between measurer and thing measured, it runs into trouble when there is only one cosmic system, a single interconnected whole. Even so, the spirit of Copenhagen may well survive. Invoking a process termed “decoherence,” physicists argue that the internal interactions of a complex quantum system constitute a kind of incessant self-measurement that allows the system as whole to display fixed and definite properties even though the underlying quantum state is in constant flux. These properties by virtue of their steadiness, come to be seen as independent and objectively real, and are therefore the very properties that we naturally label classical. If this scheme succeeds, it would give substance to Heisenberg’s remark that classical physics “is just that idealization in which we can speak about parts of the world without any reference to ourselves.”
>
>This remains to be seen. For now, critics may persist in complaining that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is less than satisfactory because it leaves us in the dark on certain elementary questions. It cannot say, indeed makes a point of not saying, what the quantum world is “really” like, and it runs into trouble with cosmic questions. But I prefer to portray these flaws as virtues. The Copenhagen interpretation provides a reliable way of using quantum mechanics, and the questions it cannot answer are precisely those questions that will not be answered until physicists have solved their last fundamental puzzle – how to marry quantum mechanics to gravity. Experiments of the EPR type illustrate one way these two parts of physics remain at odds. A measurement on one particle, it seems, can instantly fix the previously indeterminate properties of its partner, even when the two are by classical standards quite separate. This nonlocality, as physicists call it (Einstein referred to it, with open distaste, as “spooky action at a distance”) is by now empirically undeniable, but at the same time appears to be at odds with the spirit of classical causality embodied in general relativity.

### The history of quantum theory [p. 11]

>In 1924 de Broglie in France tried to extend the dualism between wave description and particle description to the elementary particles of matter, primarily to the electrons. He showed that a certain matter wave could “correspond” to a moving electron, just as a light wave corresponds to a moving light quantum. It was not clear at the time what the word “correspond” meant in this connection. But de Broglie suggested that the quantum condition in Bohr’s theory should be interpreted as a statement about the matter waves. A wave circling around a nucleus can for geometrical reasons only be a stationary wave; and the perimeter of the orbit must be an integer multiple of the wave length. […]
>
>The other development followed de Broglie’s idea of matter waves. Schrödinger tried to set up a wave equation for de Broglie’s stationary waves around the nucleus. Early in 1926 he succeeded in deriving the energy values of the stationary states of the hydrogen atom as “Eigenvalues” of his wave equation and could give a more general prescription for transforming a given set of classical equations of motion into a corresponding wave equation in a space of many dimensions. Later he was able to prove that his formalism of wave mechanics was mathematically equivalent to the earlier formalism of quantum mechanics.
>
>Thus one finally had a consistent mathematical formalism, which could be defined in two equivalent ways starting either from relations between matrices or from wave equations. This formalism gave the correct energy values for the hydrogen atom; it took less than one year to show that is was also successful for the helium atom and the more complicated problems of the heavier atoms. But in what sense did the new formalism describe the atom? The paradoxes of the dualism between wave picture and particle picture were not solved; they were hidden somehow in the mathematical scheme.
>
>A first and very interesting step toward a real understanding of quantum theory was taken by Bohr, Kramers and Slater in 1924. These authors tried to solve the apparent contradiction between the wave picture and the particle picture by the concept of the probability wave. The electromagnetic waves were interpreted not as “real” waves but as probability waves, the intensity of which determines in every point the probability for the absorption (or induced emission) of a light quantum by an atom at this point. This idea led to the conclusion that the laws of conservation of energy and momentum need not be true for the single event, that they are only statistical laws and are true only in the statistical average. This conclusion was not correct, however, and the connections between the wave aspect and the particle aspect of radiation were still more complicated.
>
>But the paper of Bohr, Kramers and Slater revealed one essential feature of the correct interpretation of quantum theory. This concept of the probability wave was something entirely new in theoretical physics since Newton. Probability in mathematics or in statistical mechanics means a statement about our degree of knowledge of the actual situation. In throwing dice we do not know the fine details of the motion of our hands which determine the fall of the dice and therefore we say that the probability for throwing a special number is just one in six. The probability wave of Bohr, Kramers, Slater, however, meant more than that; it meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative version of the old concept of “potentia” in Aristotelian philosophy. It introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an even and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.
>
>Later when the mathematical framework of quantum theory was fixed, Born took up this idea of the probability wave and gave a clear definition of the mathematical quantity in the formalism, which was to be interpreted as the probability wave. It was not a three-dimensional wave like elastic or radio waves, but a wave in the many-dimensional configuration space, and therefore a rather abstract mathematical quantity.
>
>Even at this time, in the summer of 1926, it was not clear in every case how the mathematical formalism should be used to describe a given experimental situation. One knew how to describe the stationary states of an atom, but one did not know how to describe a much simpler event – as for instance an electron moving through a cloud chamber.
>
>When Schrödinger in that summer had shown that his formalism of wave mechanics was mathematically equivalent to quantum mechanics he tried for some time to abandon the idea of quanta and “quantum jumps” altogether and to replace the electrons in the atoms simply by his three-dimensional matter waves. He was inspired to this attempt by his result, that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom in his theory seemed to be simply the eigenfrequencies of the stationary matter waves. Therefore, he thought it was a mistake to call them energies; they were just frequencies. But in the discussions which took place in the autumn of 1926 in Copenhagen between Bohr and Schrödinger and the Copenhagen group of physicists it soon became apparent that such an interpretation would not even be sufficient to explain Planck’s formula of heat radiation.
>
>During the months following these discussions an intensive study of all questions concerning the interpretation of quantum theory in Copenhagen finally led to a complete and, as many physicists believe, satisfactory clarification of the situation. But it was not a solution which one could easily accept. I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till every late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be as absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?

### The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory [p. 21]

>It has been said that the atom consists of a nucleus and electrons moving around the nucleus; it has also been stated that the concept of an electronic orbit is doubtful. […]
>
>At the same time one can easily see that there is no way of observing the orbit of the electron around the nucleus. The second step shows a wave pocket moving not around the nucleus but away from the atom, because the first light quantum will have knocked the electron out from the atom. The momentum of light quantum of the gamma-ray is much bigger than the original momentum of the electron if the wave length of the gamma-ray is much smaller than the size of the atom. Therefore, the first light quantum is sufficient to knock the electron out of the atom and one can never observe more than one point in the orbit of the electron; therefore, there is no orbit in the ordinary sense. The next observation – the third step – will show the electron on its path from the atom. Quite generally there is no way of describing what happens between two consecutive observations. It is of course tempting to say that the electron must have been somewhere between the two observations and that therefore the electron must have described some kind of path or orbit even if it may be impossible to know which path. This would be a reasonable argument in classical physics. But in quantum theory it would be a misuse of the language which, as we will see later, cannot be justified. We can leave it open for the moment, whether this warning is a statement about the way in which we should talk about atomic events or a statement about the vents themselves, whether it refers to epistemology or to ontology. In any case we have to be very cautious about the wording of any statement concerning the behavior of atomic particles.
>
>Actually we need not speak of particles at all. For many experiments it is more convenient to speak of matter waves; for instance, of stationary matter waves around the atomic nucleus. Such a description would directly contradict the other description if one does not pay attention to the limitations given by the uncertainty relations. Through the limitations the contradiction is avoided. The use of “matter waves” is convenient, for example, when dealing with the radiation emitted by the atom. By means of its frequencies and intensities the radiation gives information about the oscillating charge distribution in the atom, and there the wave picture comes much nearer to the truth than the particle picture. Therefore, Bohr advocated the use of both pictures, which he called “complementary” to each other. The two pictures are of course mutually exclusive, because a certain thing cannot at the same time be a particle (i.e., substance confined to a very small volume) and a wave (i.e., a field spread out over a large space), but the two complement each other. By playing with both pictures, by going from the one picture to the other and back again, we finally get the right impression of the strange kind of reality behind our atomic experiments. […] The space-time description of the atomic events is complementary to their deterministic description. The probability function obeys an equation of motion as the co-ordinates did in Newtonian mechanics; its change in the course of time is completely determined by the quantum mechanical equation, but it does not allow a description in space and time. The observation, on the other hand, enforces the description in space and time but breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by changing our knowledge of the system. […]
>
>A real difficulty in the understanding of this interpretation arises, however, when one asks the famous question: But what happens “really” in an atomic event? […] We cannot completely objectify the result of an observation, we cannot describe what “happens” between this observation and the next. This looks as if we had introduced an element of subjectivism into the theory, as if we meant to say: what happens depends on our way of observing it or on the fact that we observe it. Before discussing this problem of subjectivism it is necessary to explain quite clearly why one would get into hopeless difficulties if one tried to describe what happens between two consecutive observations. […]
>
>The observation plays a decisive role in the event and the reality varies, depending upon whether we observe it or not. To make this point cleared we have to analyze the process of observation more closely.
>
>To begin with, it is important to remember that in natural science we are not interested in the universe as a whole, including ourselves, but we direct our attention to some part of the universe and make that the object of our studies. In atomic physics this part is usually a very small object, an atomic particle or a group of such particles, sometimes much larger – the size does not matter; but it is important that a large part of the universe, including ourselves, does not belong to the object. […]
>
>The probability function does – unlike the common procedure in Newtonian mechanics – not describe a certain event but, at least during the process of observation, a whole ensemble of possible events.
>
>The observation itself changes the probability function discontinuously; it selects of all possible events the actual one that has taken place. Since through the observation our knowledge of the system has changed discontinuously, its mathematical representation also has undergone the discontinuous change and we speak of a “quantum jump.” When the old adage “Natura non facit saltus” is used as a basis for criticism of quantum theory, we can reply that certainly our knowledge can change suddenly and that this fact justifies the use of the term “quantum jump.”
>
>Therefore, the transition from the “possible” to the “actual” takes place during the act of observation. If we want to describe what happens in an atomic event, we have to realize that the word “happens” can apply only to the observation, not to the state of affairs between two observations. It applies to the physical, not the psychical act of observation, and we may say that the transition from the “possible” to the “actual” takes place as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby with the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer. The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function. […]
>
>It has sometimes been suggested that one should depart from the classical concepts altogether and that a radical change in the concepts used for describing the experiments might possibly lead back to a nonstatical, completely objective description of nature.
>
>This suggestion, however, rests upon a misunderstanding. The concepts of classical physics are just a refinement of the concepts of daily life and are an essential part of the language which forms the basis of all natural science. Our actual situation in science is such that we do use the classical concepts for the description of the experiments, and it was the problem of quantum theory to find theoretical interpretation of the experiments on this basis. There is no use in discussing what could be done if we were other beings than we are. At this point we have to realize, as von Weizsäcker has put it, that “Nature is earlier than man, but man is earlier than natural science.” The first part of the sentence justifies classical physics, with its ideal of complete objectivity. The second part tells us why we cannot escape the paradox of quantum theory, namely, the necessity of using the classical concepts. […]
>
>If the measuring device would be isolated from the rest of the world, it would be neither a measuring device not could it be described in the terms of classical physics at all.
>
>With regard to this situation Bohr has emphasized that it is more realistic to state that the division into the object and the rest of the world is not arbitrary. Our actual situation in research work in atomic physics is usually this: we wish to understand a certain phenomenon, we wish to recognize how this phenomenon follows from the general laws of nature. Therefore, the part of matter or radiation which takes part in the phenomenon is the natural “object” in the theoretical treatment and should be separated in this respect from the tools used to study the phenomenon. This again emphasizes a subjective element in the description of atomic events, since the measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning. Our scientific work in physics consists in asking questions about nature in the language that we possess and trying to get an answer from experiment by the means that are at our disposal. In this way quantum theory reminds us, as Bohr has put it, of the old wisdom that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both players and spectators. It is understandable that in our scientific relation to nature our own activity becomes very important when we have to deal with parts of nature into which we can penetrate only by using the most elaborate tools.

### Quantum theory and the roots of atomic science [p. 33]

>The idea of the smallest, indivisible ultimate building blocks of matter first came up in connection with the elaboration of the concepts of Matter, Being and Becoming with characterized the first epoch of Greek philosophy. This period started in the sixth century B.C. with Thales, the founder of the Milesian school, to whom Aristotle ascribes the statement: “Water is the material cause of all things.” This statement, strange as it looks to us, expressed, as Nietzsche has pointed out, three fundamental ideas of philosophy. First, the question as to the material cause of all things; second, the demand that this question be answered in conformity with reason, without resort to myths or mysticism; third, the postulate that ultimately it must be possible to reduce everything to one principle. Thales’ statement was the first expression of the idea of a fundamental substance, of which all other things were transient forms. The word “substance” in this connection was certainly in that age not interpreted in the purely material sense which we frequently ascribe to it today. Life was connected with or inherent in this “substance” and Aristotle ascribes to Thales also the statement: All things are full of gods. Still the question was put as to the material cause of all things and it is not difficult to imagine that Thales took his view primarily from meteorological considerations. Of all things we know water can take the most various shapes; it can in the winter take the form of ice and snow, it can change into vapor, and it can form the clouds. It seems to turn into earth where the rivers form their delta, and it can spring from the earth. Water is the condition for life. Therefore, if there was such a fundamental substance, it was natural to think of water first.
>
>The idea of the fundamental substance was then carried further by Anaximander, who was a pupil of Thales and lived in the same town. Anaximander denied the fundamental substance to be water or any of the known substances. He taught that the primary substance was infinite, eternal and ageless and that it encompassed the world. This primary substance is transformed into the various substances with which we are familiar. Theophrastus quotes from Anaximander: “Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more, as is ordained, for they make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time.” In this philosophy the antithesis of Being and Becoming plays the fundamental role. The primary substance, infinite and ageless, the undifferentiated Being, degenerates into the various forms which lead to endless struggles. The process of Becoming is considered as a sort of debasement of the infinite Being – a disintegration into the struggle ultimately expiated by a return into that which is without shape or character. The struggle which is meant here is the opposition between hot and cold, fire and water, wet and dry, etc. The temporary victory of the one over the other is the injustice for which they finally make reparation in the ordering of time. According to Anaximander, there is “eternal motion,” the creation and passing away of worlds from infinity to infinity.
>
>It may be interesting to notice at this point that the problem – whether the primary substance can be one of the known substances or must be something essentially different – occurs in a somewhat different form in the most modern part of atomic physics. The physicists today try to find a fundamental law of motion for matter from which all elementary particles and their properties can be derived mathematically. This fundamental equation of motion may refer either to waves of a known type, to proton and meson waves, or to waves of an essentially different character which have nothing to do with any of the known waves or elementary particles. In the first case it would mean that all other elementary particles can be reduced in some way to a few sorts of “fundamental” elementary particles; actually theoretical physics has during the past two decades mostly followed this line of research. In the second case all different elementary particles could be reduced to some universal substance which we may call energy or matter, but none of the different particles could be preferred to the others as being more fundamental. The latter view of course corresponds to the doctrine of Anaximander, and I am convinced that in modern physics this view is the correct one. But let us return to Greek philosophy.
>
>The third of the Milesian philosophers, Anaximenes, an associate of Anaximander, taught that air as the primary substance. “Just as our soul, being air, holds us together, so do breath and air encompass the whole world.” Anaximenes introduced into the Milesian philosophy the idea that the process of condensation or rarefaction causes the change of the primary substance into the other substances. The condensation of water vapor into clouds was an obvious example, and of course the difference between water vapor and air was not known at that time.
>
>In the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus, the concept of Becoming occupies the foremost place. He regarded that which moves, the first, as the basic element. The difficulty, to reconcile the idea of one fundamental principle with the infinite variety of phenomena, is solved for him by recognizing that the strife of the opposites is really a kind of harmony. For Heraclitus the world is at once one and many, it is just “the opposite tension” of the opposites that constitutes the unity of the One. He says: “We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.”
>
>Looking back to the development of Greek philosophy up to this point one realizes that is has been borne from the beginning to this stage by the tension between the One and the Many. For our senses the world consists of an infinite variety of things and events, colors and sounds. But in order to understand it we have to introduce some kind of order, and order means to recognize what is equal, it means some sort of unity. From this springs the belief that there is one fundamental principle, and at the same time the difficulty to derive from it the infinite variety of things. That there should be a material cause for all things was a natural starting point since the world consists of matter. But when one carried the idea of fundamental unity to the extreme one came to that infinite and eternal undifferentiated Being which, whether material or not, cannot in itself explain the infinite variety of things. This leads to the antithesis of Being and Becoming and finally to the solution of Heraclitus, that the change itself is the fundamental principle, the “imperishable change, that renovates the world,” as the poets have called it. But the change in itself is not a material cause and therefore is represented in the philosophy of Heraclitus by the fire as the basic element, which is both matter and a moving force.
>
>We may remark at this point that modern physics is in some way extremely near to the doctrines of Heraclitus. If we replace the word “fire” by the word “energy” we can almost repeat his statements word for word from our modern point of view. Energy is in fact the substance from which all elementary particles, all atoms and therefore all things are made, and energy is that which moves. Energy is a substance, since its total amount does not change, and the elementary particles can actually be made from this substance as is seen in many experiments on the creation of elementary particles. Energy can be changed into motion, into heat, into light and into tension. Energy may be called the fundamental cause for all change in the world. But this comparison of Greek philosophy with the ideas of modern science will be discussed later.
>
>Greek philosophy returned for some time to the concept of the One in the teaching of Parmenides, who lived in Elea in the south of Italy. His most important contribution to Greek thinking was, perhaps, that he introduced a purely logical argument into metaphysics. “One cannot know what is not – that is impossible – nor utter it; for it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.” Therefore, only the One is, and there is no becoming or passing away. Parmenides denied the existence of empty space for logical reasons. Since all change requires empty space, as he assumed, he dismissed change as an illusion.
>
>But philosophy could not rest for long on this paradox. Empedocles, from the south coast of Sicily, changed for the first time from monism to a kind of pluralism. To avoid the difficulty that one primary substance cannot explain the variety of things and events, he assumed four basic elements, earth, water, air and fire. The elements are mixed together and separated by the action of Love and Strife. Therefore, these latter two, which are in many ways treated as corporeal like the other four elements, are responsible for the imperishable change. Empedocles describes the formation of the world in the following picture: First, there is the infinite Sphere of the One, as in the philosophy of Parmenides. But in the primary substance all the four “roots” are mixed together by Love. Then, when Love is passing out and Strife coming in, the elements are partially separated and partially combined. After that the elements are completely separated and Love is outside the World. Finally, Love is bringing the elements together again and Strife is passing out, so that we return to the original Sphere.
>
>This doctrine of Empedocles represents a very definite turning toward a more materialistic view in Greek philosophy. The four elements are not so much fundamental principles as real material substances. Here for the first time the idea is expressed that the mixture and separation of a few substances, which are fundamentally different, explains the infinite variety of things and events. Pluralism never appeals to those who are wont to think in fundamental principles. But it is a reasonable kind of compromise, which avoids the difficulty of monism and allows the establishment of some order.
>
>The next step toward the concept of the atom was made by Anaxagoras, who was a contemporary of Empedocles. He lives in Athens about thirty years, probably in the first half of the fifth century B.C. Anaxagoras stresses the idea of the mixture, the assumption that all change is caused by mixture and separation. He assumed an infinite variety of infinitely small “seeds,” of which all things are composed. The seeds do not refer to the four elements of Empedocles, there are innumerably many different seeds. But the seeds are mixed together and separated again and in this way all change is brought about. The doctrine of Anaxagoras allows for the first time a geometrical interpretation of the term “mixture”: Since he speaks of the infinitely small seeds, their mixture can be pictured as the mixture between two kinds of sand of different colors. The seeds may change in number and in relative position. Anaxagoras assumes that all seeds are in everything, only the proportion may change from one thing to another. He says: “All things will be in everything, nor is it possible for them to be apart, but all things have a portion of everything.” The universe of Anaxagoras is set in motion not by Love and Strife, like that of Empedocles, but by “Nous,” which we may translate as “Mind.”
>
>From this philosophy it was only one step to the concept of the atom, and this step occurred with Leucippus and Democritus of Abdera. The antithesis of Being and Not-being in the philosophy of Parmenides is here secularized into the antithesis of the “Full” and the “Void.” Being is not only One, it can be repeated an infinite number of times. This is the atom, the indivisible smallest unit of matter. The atom is eternal and indestructible, but it has a finite size. Motion is made possible through the empty space between the atoms. Thus for the first time in history there was voiced the idea of the existence of smallest ultimate particles – we would say of elementary particles, as the fundamental blocks of matter.
>
>According to this new concept of the atom, matter did not consist only of the “Full,” but also of the “Void,” of the empty space in which the atoms move. The logical objection of Parmenides against the Void, that not-being cannot exist, was simply ignored to comply with experience. From our modern point of view we would say that the empty space between the atoms in the philosophy of Democritus was not nothing; it was the carrier for geometry and kinematics, making possible the various arrangements and movements of atoms. But the possibility of empty space has always been a controversial problem in philosophy. In the theory of general relativity the answer is given that geometry is produced by matter or matter by geometry. This answer corresponds more closely to the view held by many philosophers that space is defined by the extension of matter. But Democritus clearly departs from this view, to make change and action possible.
>
>The atoms of Democritus were all of the same substance, which had the property of being, but ha different sizes and different shapes. They were pictured therefore as divisible in a mathematical but not in a physical sense. The atoms could move and could occupy different positions in space. But they had no other physical properties. They had neither color nor smell nor taste. The properties of matter which we perceive by our senses were supposed to be produced by the movements and positions of the atoms in space. Just as both tragedy and comedy can be written by using the same letters of the alphabet, the vast variety of events in this world can be realized by the same atoms through their different arrangements and movements. Geometry and kinematics, which were made possible by the void, proved to be still more important in some way than pure being. Democritus is quoted to have said: “A thing merely appears to have color, it merely appears to be sweet or bitter. Only atoms and empty space have a real existence.”
>
>The atoms in the philosophy of Leucippus do not move merely by chance. Leucippus seems to have believed in complete determinism, since he is known to have said: “Naught happens for nothing, but everything from a ground and of necessity.” The atomists did not give any reason for the original motion of the atoms, which just shows that they thought of a causal description of the atomic motion; causality can only explain later events by earlier events, but it can never explain the beginning.
>
>The basic ideas of atomic theory were taken over and modified, in part, by later Greek philosophers. For the sake of comparison with modern atomic physics it is important to mention the explanation of matter by Plato in his dialogue Timaeus. Plato was not an atomist; on the contrary, Diogenes Laertius reported that Plato disliked Democritus so much that he wished all his books to be burned. But Plato combined ideas that were near to atomism with doctrines of the Pythagorean school and the teachings of Empedocles. […]
>
>Plato knew of the discovery of the regular solids made by the Pythagoreans and of the possibility of combining them with the elements of Empedocles. He compared the smallest parts of the element earth with the cube, of air with the octahedron, of fire with the tetrahedron, and of water with the icosahedron. There is no element that corresponds to the dodecahedron, here Plato only says “there was yet a fifth combination which God used in the delineation of the universe.” […]
>
>One atom of fire and two atoms of air can be combined to give one atom of water. But the fundamental triangles cannot be considered as matter, since they have no extension in space. It is only when the triangles are put together to form a regular solid that a unit of matter is created. The smallests parts of matter are not the fundamental Beings, as in the philosophy of Democritus, but are mathematical forms. Here it is quite evident that the form is more important than the substance of which it is the form. […]
>
>It is obvious that if anything in modern physics should be compared with the atoms of Democritus it should be the elementary particles like proton, neutron, electron, meson.
>
>Democritus was well aware of the fact that if the atoms should, by their motion and arrangement, explain the properties of matter – color, smell, taste – they cannot themselves have these properties. Therefore, he has deprived the atom of these qualities and his atom is thus a rather abstract piece of matter. But Democritus has left to the atom the quality of “being,” of extension in space, of shape and motion. He has left these qualities because it would have been difficult to speak about the atom at all if such qualities had been taken away from it. On the other hand, this implies that his concept of the atom cannot explain geometry, extension in space or existence, because it cannot reduce them to something more fundamental. The modern view of the elementary particle with regard to this point seems more consistent and more radical. […] If one wants to give an accurate description of the elementary particle – and here the emphasis is on the word “accurate” – the only thing which can be written down as description is a probability function. But then one sees that not even the quality of being (if that may be called a “quality”) belongs to what is described. It is a possibility for being or a tendency for being. Therefore, the elementary particle of modern physics is still far more abstract than the atom of the Greeks, and it is by this very property more consistent as a clue for explaining the behavior of matter.
>
>In the philosophy of Democritus all atoms consist of the same substance if the word “substance” is to be applied here at all. The elementary particles in modern physics carry a mass in the same limited sense in which they have other properties. Since mass and energy are, according to the theory of relativity, essentially the same concepts, we may say that all elementary particles consist of energy. This could be interpreted as defining energy as the primary substance of the world. […]
>
>Modern physics takes a definite stand against the materialism of Democritus and for Plato and the Pythagoreans. The elementary particles are certainly not eternal and indestructible units of matter, they can actually be transformed into each other. As a matter of fact, if two such particles, moving through space with a very high kinetic energy, collide, then many new elementary particles may be created from the available energy and the old particles may have disappeared in the collision. Such events have been frequently observed and offer the best proof that all particles are made of the same substance: energy. But the resemblance of the modern views to those of Plato and the Pythagoreans can be carried somewhat further. The elementary particles in Plato’s Timaeus are finally not substance but mathematical forms. “All things are numbers” is a sentence attributed to Pythagoras. The only mathematical forms available at that time were such geometric forms as the regular solids or the triangles which form their surface. In modern quantum theory there can be no doubt that the elementary particles will finally also be mathematical forms, but of a much more complicated nature. The Greek philosophers thought of static forms and found them in the regular solids. Modern science, however, has from its beginning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries started from the dynamic problem. The constant element in physics since Newton is not a configuration or a geometrical form, but a dynamic law. The equation of motion holds at all times, it is in this sense eternal, whereas the geometrical forms, like the orbits, are changing. Therefore, the mathematical forms that represent the elementary particles will be solutions of some eternal law of motion for matter. Actually this is a problem which has not yet been solves. The fundamental law of motion for matter is not yet known and therefore it is not yet possible to derive mathematically the properties of the elementary particles from such a law. But theoretical physics in its present state seems to be not very far from this goal and we can at least say what kind of law we have to expect. The final equation of motion for matter will probably be some quantized nonlinear wave equation for a wave field of operators that simply represents matter, not any specified kind of waves or particles. This wave equation will probably be equivalent to rather complicated sets of integral equations, which have “Eingevalues” and “Eigensolutions,” as the physicists call it. These Eigensolutions will finally represent the elementary particles; they are the mathematical forms which shall replace the regular solids of the Pythagoreans. We might mention here that these “Eigensolutions” will follow from the fundamental equation for matter by much the same mathematical process by which the harmonic vibrations of the Pythagorean string follow from the differential equation of the string. But, as has been said, these problems are not yet solved.
>
>Why do the physicists claim that their elementary particles cannot be divided into smaller bits? The answer to this question clearly shows how much more abstract modern science is as compared to Greek philosophy. The argument runs like this: How could one divide an elementary particle? Certainly only by using extreme forces and very sharp tools. The only tools available are other elementary particles. Therefore, collisions between two elementary particles of extremely high energy would be the only processes by which the particles could eventually be divided. Actually they can be divided in such processes, sometimes into very many fragments; but the fragments are again elementary particles, not any smaller pieces of them, the masses of these fragments resulting from the very large kinetic energy of the two colliding particles. In other words, the transmutation of energy into matter makes it possible that the fragments of elementary particles are again the same elementary particles.

### The development of philosophic ideas since Descartes in comparison with the new situation in quantum theory [p. 50]

>In the first centuries of Greek culture the strongest impulse had come from the immediate reality of the world in which we live and which we perceive by our senses. This reality was full of life and there was no good reason to stress the distinction between matter and mind or between body and soul. But in the philosophy of Plato one already sees that another reality begins to become stronger. In the famous simile of the cave Plato compares men to prisoners in a cave who are bound and can look in only one direction. They have a fire behind them and see on a wall the shadows of themselves and of objects behind them. Since they see nothing but the shadows, they regard those shadows as real and are not aware of the objects. Finally one of the prisoners escapes and comes from the cave into the light of the sun. For the first time he sees real things and realizes that he had been deceived hitherto by the shadows. For the first time he knows the truth and thinks only with sorrow of his long life in the darkness. The real philosopher is the prisoner who has escaped from the cave into the light of truth, he is the one who possesses real knowledge. This immediate connection with truth or, we may in the Christian sense say, with God is the new reality that has begun to become stronger than the reality of the world as perceived by our senses. The immediate connection with God happens within the human soul, not in the world, and this was the problem that occupied human thought more than anything else in the two thousand years following Plato. In this period the eyes of the philosophers were directed toward the human soul and its relation to God, to the problems of ethics, and to the interpretation of the revelation but not to the outer world. It was only in the time of the Italian Renaissance that again a gradual change of the human mind could be seen, which resulted finally in a revival of the interest in nature. […]
>
>The first great philosopher of this new period of science was René Descartes who lives in the first half of the seventeenth century. Those of his ideas that are most important for the development of scientific thinking are contained in his Discourse on Method. On the basis of doubt and logical reasoning the tries to find a completely new and as he thinks solid ground for a philosophical system. He does not accept revelation as such a basis nor does he want to accept uncritically what is perceived by the senses. So he starts with his method of doubt. He casts hid doubt upon that which our senses tell us about the results of our reasoning and finally he arrives at his famous sentence: “cogito ergo sum.” I cannot doubt my existence since it follows from the fact that I am thinking. After establishing the existence of the I in this way he proceeds to prove the existence of God essentially on the lines of scholastic philosophy. Finally the existence of the world follows from the fact that God had given me a strong inclination to believe in the existence of the world, and it is simply impossible that God should have deceived me. […]
>
>Descartes realizes that what we know about our mind is more certain than what we know about the outer world. But already his starting point with the “triangle” God-World-I simplifies in a dangerous way the basis for further reasoning. The division between matter and mind or between soul and body, which had started in Plato’s philosophy, is now complete. God is separated from the I and from the world. God in fact is raised so high above the world and men that He finally appears in the philosophy of Descartes only as a common point of reference that establishes the relation between the I and the world.
>
>While ancient Greek philosophy had tried to find order in the infinite variety of things and events by looking for some fundamental unifying principle, Descartes tries to establish the order through some fundamental division. But the three parts which result from the division lose some of their essence when any one part is considered as separated from the other two parts. […]
>
>This empirical knowledge could be formulated without speaking about God or about ourselves and favored the separation of the three fundamental concepts God-World-I. […]
>
>In natural science the partition was for several centuries extremely successful. The mechanics of Newton and all the other parts of classical physics constructed after its model started from the assumption that one can describe the world without speaking about God or ourselves. The possibility soon seemed almost a necessary condition for natural science in general.
>
>But at this point the situation changed to some extent through quantum theory. […] This was a possibility of which Descartes could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation between the world and the I impossible. […]
>
>The position to which the Cartesian partition has led with respect to the “res extensa” was what one may call metaphysical realism. The world, i.e., the extended things, “exist.” This is to be distinguished from practical realism, and the different forms of realism may be described as follows: We “objectivate” a statement if we claim that its content does not depend on the conditions under which it can be verified. Practical realism assumes that there are statements that can be objectivated and that in fact the largest part of our experience in daily life consists of such statements. Dogmatic realism claims that there are no statements concerning the material world that cannot be objectivated. […] When Einstein has criticized quantum theory he has done so from the basis of dogmatic realism. This is a very natural attitude. […] But quantum theory is in itself an example for the possibility of explaining nature by means of simple mathematical laws without this basis. […]
>
>Metaphysical realism goes one step further than dogmatic realism by saying that “the things really exist.” This is in fact what Descartes tried to prove by the argument that “God cannot have deceived us.” The statement that the things really exist is different from the statement of dogmatic realism in so far as here the word “exists” occurs, which is also meant in the other statement “cogito ergo sum”… “I think therefore I am.” But it is difficult to see what is meant at this point that is not yet contained in the thesis of dogmatic realism; and this leads us to a general criticism of the statement “cogito ergo sum,” which Descartes considered as the solid ground on which he could build his system. It is in fact true that this statement has the certainty of a mathematical conclusion, if the words “cogito” and “sum” are defined in the usual way or, to put it more cautiously and at the same time more critically, if the words are so defined that the statement follows. But this does not tell us anything about how far we can use the concepts of “thinking” and “being” in finding our way. It is finally in a very general sense always an empirical question how far our concepts can be applied.
>
>The difficulty of metaphysical realism was felt soon after Descartes and became the starting point for the empiristic philosophy, for sensualism and positivism.
>
>The three philosophers who can taken as representatives for early empiristic philosophy are Locke, Berkeley and Hume. Locke holds, contrary to Descartes, that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience. This experience may be sensation or perception of the operation of our own mind. Knowledge, so Locke states, is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas. The next step was taken by Berkeley. If actually all our knowledge is derived from perception, there is no meaning in the statement that the things really exist; because if the perception is given it cannot possibly make any different whether the things exist or do not exist. Therefore, to be perceived is identical with existence. This line of argument then was extended to an extreme skepticism by Hume, who denied induction and causation and thereby arrived at a conclusion which if taken seriously would destroy the basis of all empirical science.
>
>The criticism of metaphysical realism which has been expressed in empiristic philosophy is certainly justified in so far as it is a warning against the naive use of the term “existence.” The positive statements of this philosophy can be criticized on similar lines. Our perceptions are not primarily bundles of colors or sounds; what we perceive is already perceived as something, the accent here being on the word “thing,” and therefore it is doubtful whether we gain anything by taking the perceptions instead of the things as the ultimate elements of reality.
>
>The underlying difficulty has been clearly recognized by modern positivism. This line of thought expressed criticism against the naive use of certain terms like “thing,” “perception,” “existence” by the general postulate that the question whether a given sentence has any meaning at all should always be thoroughly and critically examined. This postulate and its underlying attitude are derived from mathematical logic. […]
>
>A combination of those two lines of thought that started from Descartes, on the one side, and from Locke and Berkeley, on the other, was attempted in the philosophy of Kant, who was the founder of German idealism. That part of his work which is important in comparison with the results of modern physics is contained in The Critique of Pure Reason. He takes up the question whether knowledge is only founded in experience or can come from other sources, and he arrives at the conclusion that our knowledge is in part “a priori” and not inferred inductively from experience. Therefore, he distinguishes between “empirical” knowledge and knowledge that is “a priori.” At the same time he distinguishes between “analytic” and “synthetic” propositions. Analytic propositions follow simply from logic, and their denial would lead to self-contradiction. Propositions that are not “analytic” are called “synthetic.” […]
>
>Space and time are, he says, a priori forms of pure intuition. In the case of space he gives the following metaphysical arguments:
>
>1. Space is not an empirical concept, abstracted from other experiences, for space is presupposed in referring sensations to something external, and external experience is only possible through the presentation of space.
>
>2. Space is a necessary presentation a priori, which underlies all external perceptions; for we cannot imagine that there should be no space, although we can imagine that there should be nothing in space.
>
>3. Space is not a discursive or general concept of the relations of things in general, for there is only one space, of which what we call “spaces” are parts, not instances.
>
>4. Space is presented as an infinite given magnitude, which holds within itself all the parts of space; this relation is different from that of a concept to its instances, and therefore space is not a concept but a form of intuition. […]
>
>Kant has not followed the line of Berkeley and Hume, though that would have been logically consistent. He kept the notion of the “thing-in-itself” as different from the percept, and in this way kept some connection with realism.
>
>Coming now to the comparison of Kant’s doctrines with modern physics, it looks in the first moment as though his central concept of the “synthetic judgments a priori” had been completely annihilated by the discoveries of our century. The theory of relativity has changed our views on space and time, it has in fact revealed entirely new features of space and time, of which nothing is seen in Kant’s a priori forms of pure intuition. The law of causality is no longer applied in quantum theory and the law of conservation of matter is no longer true for the elementary particles. Obviously Kant could not have foreseen the new discoveries, but since he was convinced that his concepts would be “the basis of any future metaphysics that can be called science” it is interesting to see where his arguments have been wrong. […]
>
>The a priori concepts which Kant considered an undisputable truth are no longer contained in the scientific system of modern physics. […]
>
>What we have learned especially from the discussion of the philosophies of Descartes and Kant may perhaps be stated in the following way:
>
>Any concepts or words which have been formed in the past through the interplay between the world and ourselves are not really sharply defined with respect to their meaning; that is to say, we do not know exactly how far they will help us in finding our way in the world. We often know that they can be applied to a wide range of inner or outer experience, but we practically never know precisely the limits of their applicability. This is true even of the simplest and most general concepts like “existence” and “space and time.” Therefore, it will never be possible by pure reason to arrive at some absolute truth.

### The relation of quantum theory to other parts of natural science [p. 76]

>Just as in the case of chemistry, one learns from simple biological experience that the living organisms display a degree of stability which general complicated structures consisting of many different types of molecules could certainly not have on the basis of the physical and chemical laws alone. Therefore, something has to be added to the laws of physics and chemistry before the biological phenomena can be completely understood.
>
>With regard to this question two distinctly different views have frequently been discussed in the biological literature. The one view refers to Darwin’s theory of evolution in its connection with modern genetics. According to this theory, the only concept which has to be added to those of physics and chemistry in order to understand life is the concept of history. The enormous time interval of roughly four thousand million years that has elapsed since the formation of the earth has given nature the possibility of trying an almost unlimited variety of structures of groups of molecules. Among these structures there have finally been some that could reduplicate themselves by using smaller groups from the surrounding matter, and such structures therefore could be created in great numbers. Accidental changes in the structures provided a still larger variety of the existing structures. Different structures had to compete for the material drawn from the surrounding matter and in this way, through the “survival of the fittest,” the evolution of living organisms finally took place. There can be no doubt that this theory contains a very large amount of truth, and many biologists claim that the addition of the concepts of history and evolution to the coherent set of concepts of physics and chemistry will be amply sufficient to account for all biological phenomena. One of the arguments frequently used in favor of this theory emphasizes that wherever the laws of physics and chemistry have been checked in living organisms they have always been found to be correct; there seems definitively be no place at which some “vital force” different from the forces in physics could enter.
>
>On the other hand, it is just this argument that has lost much of its weight through quantum theory. Since the concepts of physics and chemistry form a closed and coherent set, namely, that of quantum theory, it is necessary that wherever these concepts can be used to describe phenomena the laws connected with the concepts must be valid too. Therefore, wherever one treats living organisms as physicochemical systems, they must necessarily act as such. The only questions from which we can learn something about the adequacy of this first view is whether the physicochemical concepts allow a complete description of the organisms. Biologists, who answer this question in the negative, generally hold the second view, that has now to be explained.
>
>This second view can perhaps be stated in the following terms: It is very difficult to see how concepts like perception, function of an organ, affection could be a part of the coherent set of the concepts of quantum theory combined with the concept of history. On the other hand, these concepts are necessary for a complete description of life, even if for the moment we exclude mankind as presenting new problems beyond biology. Therefore, it will probably be necessary for an understanding of life to go beyond quantum theory and to construct a new coherent set of concepts, to which physics and chemistry may belong as “limiting cases;” History may be an essential part of it, and concepts like perception, adaptation, affection also will belong to it. If this view is correct, the combination of Darwin’s theory with physics and chemistry would not be sufficient to explain organic life; but still it would be true that living organisms can to a large extent be considered as physicochemical systems – as machines, as Descartes and Laplace have put it – and would, if treated as such, also react as such. One could at the same time assume, as Bohr has suggested, that our knowledge of a cell being alive may be complementary to the complete knowledge of its molecular structure. Since a complete knowledge of this structure could possibly be achieved only by operations that destroy the life of the cell, it is logically possible that life precludes the complete determination of its underlying physicochemical structure. Even if one holds this second view one would probably recommend for biological research no other method than has been pursued in the past decades: attempting to explain as much as possible on the basis of the known physicochemical laws, and describing the behavior of organisms carefully and without theoretical prejudices.
>
>The first of these two views is more common among modern biologists than the second; but the experience available at present is certainly not sufficient to decide between the two views. […]
>
>If we go beyond biology and include psychology in the discussion, then there can scarcely be any doubt but that the concepts of physics, chemistry, and evolution together will not be sufficient to describe the facts. On this point the existence of quantum theory has changed our attitude from what was believed in the nineteenth century. During that period some scientists were incline to think that the psychological phenomena could ultimately be explained on the basis of physics and chemistry of the brain. From the quantum-theoretical point of view there is no reason for such an assumption. We would, in spite of the fact that the physical events in the brain belong to the psychic phenomena, not expect that these could be sufficient to explain them. We would never doubt that the brain acts as a physico-chemical mechanism if treated as such; but for an understand of psychic phenomena we would start from the fact that the human mind enters as object and subject into the scientific process of psychology. […]
>
>When one compares this order with older classifications that belong to earlier stages of natural science one sees that one has now divided the world not into different groups of objects but into different groups of connections. In an earlier period of science one distinguished, for instance, as different groups minerals, plants, animals, men. These objects were taken according to their group as of different natures, made of different materials, and determined in their behavior by different forces. Now we know that it is always the same matter, the same various chemical compounds that may belong to any object, to minerals as well as animals or plants; also the forces that act between the different parts of matter are ultimately the same in every kind of object. What can be distinguished is the kind of connection which is primarily important in a certain phenomenon. For instance, when we speak about the action of chemical forces we mean a kind of connection which is more complicated or in any case different from that expressed in Newtonian mechanics. The world thus appears as a complicated tissue of events, in which connections of different kinds alternate or overlap or combine and thereby determine the texture of the whole.


### The theory of relativity [p. 92]

>Fifty years ago, when the theory of relativity was formulated, this hypothesis of the equivalence of mass and energy seemed to be a complete revolution in physics, and there was still very little experimental evidence for it. In tour times we see in many experiments how elementary particles can be created from kinetic energy, and how such particles are annihilated to form radiation; therefore, the transmutation from energy into mass and vice versa suggests nothing unusual. […]
>
>The equivalence of mass and energy has – besides its great importance in physics – also raised problems concerning very old philosophical questions. It has been the thesis of several philosophical questions. It has been the thesis of several philosophical systems of the past that substance or matter cannot be destroyed. In modern physics, however, many experiments have shown that elementary particles, e.g., positrons and electrons, can be annihilated and transmuted into radiation. Does this mean that these older philosophical systems have been disproved by modern experience and that the arguments brought forward by the earlier systems have been misleading?
>
>This would certainly be a rash and unjustified conclusion, since the terms “substance” and “matter” in ancient or medieval philosophy cannot simply be identified with the term “mass” in modern physics. If one wished to express our modern experience in the language of older philosophies, one could consider mass and energy as two different form of the same “substance” and thereby keep the idea of substance as indestructible. […]
>
>The concepts to which the philosophers were led in the process of intellectual clarification a long time ago cannot possibly be adapted to phenomena that can only be observed by the elaborate technical tools of our time. […]
>
>This may not seem satisfactory from a philosophical point of view, from which one would prefer to attach physical properties only to physical entities like material bodies or fields and not to empty space. But so far as the theory of electromagnetic processes or mechanical motions is concerned, this existence of physical properties of empty space is simply a description of facts that cannot be disputed. […]
>
>The theory of 1905 and 1906 is based on a very great number of well-established facts. […] Therefore, this theory belongs to the firm foundations of modern physics and cannot be disputed in our present situation.
>
>For the theory of general relativity the experimental evidence is much less convincing, since the experimental material is very scarce. There are only a few astronomical observations which allow a checking of the correctness of the assumptions. Therefore, this whole theory is more hypothetical than the first one. […]
>
>In the philosophy of Aristotle, for instance, the total space of the universe was finite (though it was infinitely divisible). Space was due to the extension of bodies, it was connected with the bodies; there was no space where there were no bodies. The universe consisted of the earth and the sun and the stars: a finite number of bodies. Beyond the sphere of the stars there was no space; therefore, the space of the universe was finite.
>
>In the philosophy of Kant this question belonged to what he called “antinomies” - questions that cannot be answered, since two different arguments lead to opposite results. Space cannot be finite, since we cannot imagine that there should be an end to space; to whichever point in space we come we can always imagine that we can go beyond. At the same time space cannot be infinite, because space is something we can imagine (else the word “space” would not have been formed) and we cannot imagine an infinite space. For this second thesis the argument of Kant has not been verbally reproduced. The sentence “space is infinite” means for us something negative; we cannot come to an end of space. For Kant it means that the infinity of space is really given, that it “exists” in a sense that we can scarcely reproduce. Kant’s result is that a rational answer to the question whether space is finite or infinite cannot be given because the whole universe cannot be the object of our experience.
>
>A similar situation is found with respect to the problem of the infinity of time. In the Confessions of St. Augustine, for instance, this question takes the form: What was God doing before He created the world? Augustine is not satisfied with the joke: “God was busy preparing Hell for those who ask foolish question.” This, he says, would be too cheap an answer, and he tries to give a rational analysis of the problem. Only for us is time passing by; it is expected by us as future; it passes by as the present moment and is remembered by us as past. But God is not in time; a thousand years are for Him as one day, and one day as a thousand years. Time has been created together with the world, it belongs to the world, therefore time did not exist before the universe existed. For God the whole course of the universe is given at once. There was no time before He created the world. It is obvious that in such statements the world “created” at once raises all the essential difficulties. This world as it is usually understood means that something has come into being that has not been before, and in this sense it presupposes that concept of time. Therefore, it is impossible to define in rational terms what could be meant by the phrase “time has been created.” This fact reminds us again of the often discussed lesson that has been learned from modern physics: that every word or concept, clear as it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability. […]
>
>From the present astronomical knowledge one cannot definitely distinguish between several possible models. It may be that the space filled by the universe is finite. This would not mean that there is an end of the universe at some place. It would only mean that by proceeding farther and farther in one direction in the universe one would finally come back to the point from which one had started. The situation would be similar as in the two-dimensional geometry on the surface of the earth where we, when starting from a point in an answered direction, finally come back to this point from the west. […]
>
>The philosophy of Kant later on drew attention to the fact that the concepts of space and time belong to our relation to nature, not to nature itself; that we could not describe nature without using these concepts. Consequently, these concepts are “a priori” in some sense, they are the condition for and not primarily the result of experience, and it was generally believed that they could not be touched by new experience.


### Criticism and counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory [p. 103]

>However, all the opponents of the Copenhagen interpretation do agree on one point. It would, in their view, be desirable to return to the reality concept of classical physics or, to use a more general philosophic term, to the ontology of materialism. They would prefer to come back to the idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or tree exist, independently of whether or not we observe them.
>
>This, however, is impossible or at least not entirely possible because of the nature of the atomic phenomena, as has been discussed in some of the earlier chapters. It cannot be our task to formulate wished as to how the atomic phenomena should be; our task can only be to understand them. […]
>
>One group of counterproposals works with the idea of “hidden parameters.” Since the quantum-theoretical laws determine in general the results of an experiment only statistically, one would from the classical standpoint be inclined to think that there exist some hidden parameters which escape observation in any ordinary experiment but which determine the outcome of the experiment in the normal causal way. Therefore, some papers try to construct such parameters within the framework of quantum mechanics.
>
>Along this line, for instance, Bohm has made a counterproposal to the Copenhagen interpretation, which as recently been taken up to some extent also by de Broglie. Bohm’s interpretation has been worked out in detail. It may therefore serve here as a basis for the discussions. Bohm considers the particles as “objectively real” structures, like the point masses in Newtonian mechanics. The waves in configuration space are in his interpretation “objectively real” too, like electric fields. Configuration space is a space of many dimensions referring to the different co-ordinates of all the particles belonging to the system. Here we meet a first difficulty: what does it mean to call waves in configuration space “real”? This space is a very abstract space. The word “real” goes back to the Latin word “res,” which means “thing”; but things are in the ordinary three-dimensional space, not in an abstract configuration space. One may call the waves in configuration space “objective” when one wants to say that these waves do not depend on any observer; but one can scarcely call them “real” unless one is willing to change the meaning of the word. Bohm goes on defining the lines perpendicular to the surfaces of constant wave-phase as the possible orbits of the particles. Which of these lines is the “real” orbit depends, according to him, on the history of the system and the measuring apparatus and cannot be decided without knowing more about the system and the measuring equipment than actually can be known. This history contains in fact the hidden parameters, the “actual orbit” before the experiment started. […]
>
>In measurements of the position of the particle, Bohm takes the ordinary interpretation of the experiments as correct; in measurements of the velocity he rejects it. At this price Bohm considers himself able to assert: “We do not need to abandon the precise, rational and objective description of individual systems in the realm of quantum theory.” This objective description, however, reveals itself as a kind of “ideological super-structure,” which has little to do with immediate physical reality; for the hidden parameters of Bohm’s interpretation are of such a kind that they can never occur in the description of real processes, if quantum theory remains unchanged.
>
>In order to escape this difficulty, Bohm does in fact express the hope that in future experiments in the range of the elementary particles the hidden parameters may yet play a physical part, and that quantum theory may thus be proved false. When such strange hopes were expressed, Bohr used to say that they were similar in structure to the sentence: “We may hope that it will later turn out that sometimes 2x2=5, for this would be of great advantage for our finances.” […]
>
>The assumption that particles are real in the sense of the materialistic ontology will always lead to the temptation to consider deviations from the uncertainty principle as “basically” possible. Fenyes, for instance, says that “the existence of the uncertainty principle [which he connects with certain statistical relations] by no means renders impossible the simultaneous measurement, with arbitrary accuracy, of position and velocity.” Fenyes dos not, however, state how such measurements should be carried out in practice, and therefore his considerations seem to remain abstract mathematics.
>
>Weizel, whose counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation are akin to those of Bohm and Fenyes, relates the “hidden parameters” to a new kind of particle introduced ad hoc, the “zeron,” which is not otherwise observable. However, such a concept runs into the danger that the interaction between the real particles and the zerons dissipates the energy among the many degrees of freedom of the zeron field, so that the whole of thermodynamics becomes a chaos. Weizel has not explained how he hopes to avoid this danger. […]
>
>The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the “possible” to the “actual,” is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory. […]
>
>We cannot possibly expect those thinkers who a century ago introduced dialectic materialism to have foreseen the development of quantum theory. Their concepts of matter and reality could not possibly be adapted to the results of the refined experimental technique of our days. […]
>
>“The reduction of wave packets,” i.e., the fact that the wave function or, more generally, the probability function changes discontinuously when the observer takes cognizance of a result of measurement. […]
>
>Now, Schrödinger’s work first of all contains some misunderstanding of the usual interpretation. He overlooks the fact that only the waves in configuration space (or the “transformation matrices”) are probability waves in the usual interpretation, while the three-dimensional matter waves or radiation waves are not. The latter have just as much and just as little “reality” as the particles; they have no direct connection with probability waves but have a continuous density of energy and momentum, like an electromagnetic field in Maxwell’s theory. Schrödinger therefore rightly emphasizes that at this point the processes can be conceived of as being more continuous than they usually are. But this interpretation cannot remove the element of discontinuity that is found everywhere in atomic physics; any scintillation screen or Geiger counter demonstrates this element at once. In the usual interpretation of quantum theory it is contained in the transition from the possible to the actual. Schrödinger himself makes no counterproposal as to how he intends to introduce the element of discontinuity, everywhere observable, in a different manner from the usual interpretation.
>
>Finally, the criticism which Einstein, Laue and others have expressed in several papers concentrates on the question whether the Copenhagen interpretation permits a unique, objective description of the physical facts. Their essential arguments may be stated in the following terms: The mathematical scheme of quantum theory seems to be a perfectly adequate description of the statistics of atomic phenomena. But even if its statements about the probability of atomic events are completely correct, this interpretation does not describe what actually happens independently of or between the observations. But something must happen, this we cannot doubt; this something need not be described in terms of electrons or waves or light quanta, but unless it is described somehow the task of physics is not completed. It cannot be admitted that it refers to the act of observation only. The physicist must postulate in his science that he is studying a world which he himself has not made and which would be present, essentially unchanged, if he were not there. Therefore, the Copenhagen interpretation offers no real understanding of the atomic phenomena.
>
>It is easily seen that what this criticism demands is again the old materialistic ontology. […]
>
>The demand to “describe what happens” in the quantum-theoretical process between two successive observations is a contradiction in adjecto, since the word “describe” refers to the use of the classical concepts, while these concepts cannot be applied in the space between the observations; they can only be applied at the points of observation.
>
>It should be noticed at this point that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory is in no way positivistic. For, whereas positivism is based on the sensual perceptions of the observer as the elements of reality, the Copenhagen interpretation regards things and processes which are describable in terms of classical concepts, i.e., the actual, as the foundation of any physical interpretation.
>
>At the same time wee that the statistical nature of the laws of microscopic physics cannot be avoided, since any knowledge of the “actual” is – because of the quantum-theoretical laws – by its very nature an incomplete knowledge.
>
>The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct “actuality” of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation is impossible, however.


### Quantum theory and the structure of matter [p. 126]

>The chemical and other properties of the atoms could be accounted for by applying the mathematical scheme of quantum theory to the electronic shells. From this basis one could try to extend the analysis of the structure of matter in two opposite directions. One could either study the interaction of atoms, their relation to larger units like molecules or crystals or biological objects; or one could try through the investigation of the atomic nucleus and its components to penetrate to the final unity of matter. Research has proceeded on both lines during the past decades. […]
>
>The forces between neighboring atoms are primarily electric forces, the attraction of opposite and the repulsion of equal charges; the electrons are attracted by the nuclei and repelled from each other. But these forces act not according to the laws of Newtonian mechanics but those of quantum mechanics.
>
>This leads to two different types of binding between atoms. […]
>
>These two types of forces, which may occur in any mixture, cause the formation of various groupings of atoms and seem to be ultimately responsible for all the complicated structures of matter in bulk that are studies in physics and chemistry. The formation of chemical compounds takes place through the formation of small closed groups of different atoms, each group being one molecule of the compound. The formation of crystals is due to the arrangement of the atoms in regular lattices. Metals are formed when the atoms are so tightly packed that their outer electrons can leave their shells and wander through the whole crystal. Magnetism is due to the spinning motion of the electron, and so on.
>
>In all these cases the dualism between matter and force can still be retained, since one may consider nuclei and electrons as the fragments of matter that are kept together by means of the electromagnetic forces.
>
>While in this way physics and chemistry have come to an almost complete union in their relations to the structure of matter, biology deals with structures of a more complicated and somewhat different type. It is true that in spite of the wholeness of the living organism a sharp distinction between animate and inanimate matter can certainly not be made. The development of biology has supplied us with a great number of examples where one can see that specific biological functions are carried by special large molecules or groups or chains of such molecules, and there has been an increasing tendency in modern biology to explain biological processes as consequences of the laws of physics and chemistry. But the kind of stability that is displayed by the living organism is of a nature somewhat different from the stability of atoms or crystals. It is a stability of process or function rather than a stability of form. There can be no doubt that the laws of quantum theory play a very important role in the biological phenomena. […]
>
>As Bohr has pointed out, it may well be that a description of the living organism that could be called complete from the standpoint of the physicist cannot be give, since it would require experiments that interfere too strongly with the biological functions. Bohr has described this situation by saying that in biology we are concerned with manifestations of possibilities in that nature to which we belong rather than with outcomes of experiments which we can ourselves perform. The situation of complementarity to which this formulation alludes is represented as a tendency in the methods of modern biological research which, on the one hand, makes full use of all the methods and results of physics and chemistry and, on the other hand, is based on concepts referring to those features of organic nature that are not contained in physics or chemistry, like the concept of life itself. […]
>
>The experiments carried out by means of cosmic radiation or of the big accelerators have revealed new interesting features of matter. Besides the three fundamental building stones of matter – electron, proton and neutron – new elementary particles have been found which can be created in these processes of highest energies and disappear again after a short time. The new particles have similar properties as the old ones except for their instability. Even the most stable ones have lifetimes of roughly only a millionth part of a second, and the lifetimes of others are even a thousand times smaller. At the present time about twenty-five different new elementary particles are known; the most recent one is the negative proton.
>
>These results seem at first sight to lead away from the idea of the unity of matter, since the number of fundamental units of matter seems to have again increased to values comparable to the number of different chemical elements. But this would not be a proper interpretation. The experiments have at the same time shown that the particles can be created from other particles or simply from the kinetic energy of such particles, and they can again disintegrate into other particles. Actually the experiments have shown the complete mutability of matter. All the elementary particles can, at sufficiently high energies, be transmuted into other particles, or they can simply be created from kinetic energy and can be annihilated into energy, for instance into radiation. Therefore, we have here actually the final proof for the unity of matter. All the elementary particles are made of the same substance, which we may call energy or universal matter; they are just different forms in which matter can appear.
>
>If we compare this situation with the Aristotelian concepts of matter and form, we can say that the matter of Aristotle, which is mere “potentia,” should be compared to our concept of energy, which gets into “actuality” by means of the form, when the elementary particle is created.
>
>Modern physics is of course not satisfied with only qualitative description of the fundamental structure of matter; it must try on the basis of careful experimental investigations to get a mathematical formulation of those natural laws that determine the “forms” of matter, the elementary particles and their forces. A clear distinction between matter and force can no longer be made in this part of physics, since each elementary particle not only is producing some forces and is acted upon by forces, but it is at the same time representing a certain field of force. The quantum-theoretical dualism of waves and particles makes the same entity appear both as matter and as force. […]
>
>The theory of relativity is connected with a universal constant in nature, the velocity of light. This constant determines the relation between space and time and is therefore implicitly contained in any natural law which must fulfill the requirements of Lorentz invariance. Our natural language and the concepts of classical physics can apply only to phenomena for which the velocity of light can be considered as practically infinite.
>
>When we in our experiments approach the velocity of light we must be prepared for results which cannot be interpreted in these concepts.
>
>Quantum theory is connected with another universal constant of nature, Planck’s quantum of action. An objective description for events in space and time is possible only when we have to deal with objects or processes on a comparatively large scale, where Planck’s constant can be regarded as infinitely small. When our experiments approach the region where the quantum of action becomes essential we get into all those difficulties with the usual concepts that have been discussed in earlier chapter of this volume.
>
>There must exist a third universal constant in nature. This is obvious for purely dimensional reasons. The universal constants determine the scale of nature, the characteristic quantities that cannot be reduced to other quantities. One needs at least three fundamental units for a complete set of units. This is most easily seen from such conventions as the use of the c-g-s system (centimeter, gram, second system) by the physicists. A unit of length, one of time, and one of mass is sufficient to form a complete set; but one must have at least three units. One could also replace them by units of length, velocity and mass; or by units of length, velocity and energy, etc. But at least three fundamental units are necessary. Now, the velocity of light and Planck’s constant of action provide only two of these units. There must be a third one, and only a theory which contains this third unit can possibly determine the masses and other properties of the elementary particles. Judging from our present knowledge of these particles the most appropriate way of introducing the third universal constant would be by the assumption of a universal length the value of which should be roughly 10-13 cm, that is, somewhat smaller than the radii of the light atomic nuclei. When from such three units one forms an expression which in its dimension corresponds to a mass, its value has the order of magnitude of the masses of the elementary particles.
>
>If we assume that the laws of nature do contain a third universal constant of the dimension of a length and of the order of 10-13 cm, the we would again expect our usual concepts to apply only to regions in space and time that are large as compared to the universal constant. We should again be prepared for phenomena of a qualitatively new character when we in our experiments approach regions in space and time smaller than the nuclear radii.

### Physics and beyond (1971)
>One evening during the Solvay Conference, some of the younger members stayed behind in the lounge of the hotel. This group included Wolfgang Pauli and myself, and was soon afterward joined by Paul Dirac. One of us said: “Einstein keeps talking about God: what are we to make of that? It is extremely difficult to imagine that a scientist like Einstein should have such strong ties with a religious tradition.”
>
>“Not so much Einstein as Max Planck,” someone objected. “From some of Planck’s utterances it would seem that he sees no contradiction between religion and science, indeed that he believes the two are perfectly compatible.”
>
>I was asked what I knew of Planck’s views on the subject, and what I thought myself. I had spoken to Planck on only few occasions, mostly about physics and not about general questions, but I was acquainted with some of Planck’s close friends, who had told me a great deal about his attitude.
>
>“I assume,” I must have replied, “that Planck considers religion and science compatible because, in his view, they refer to quite distinct facets of reality. Science deals with the objective, material world. It invites us to make accurate statements about objective reality and to grasp its interconnections. Religion, on the other hand, deals with the world of values. It considers what ought to be or what we ought to do, not what is. In science we are concerned to discover what is true or false; in religion with what is good or evil, noble or base. Science is the basis of technology, religion the basis of ethics. In short, the conflict between the two, which has been raging since the eighteenth century, seems founded on a misunderstanding, or, more precisely, on a confusion of the images and parables of religion with scientific statements. […] As far as he is concerned, therefore, the two realms – the objective and the subjective facets of the world – are quite separate, but I must confess that I myself do not feel altogether happy about this separation. I doubt whether human societies can live with so sharp a distinction between knowledge and faith.”
>
>Wolfgang shared my concern. “It’s all bound to end in tears,” he said. […] “In brief, I cannot really endorse Planck’s philosophy, even if it is logically valid and even though I respect the human attitudes to which it gives rise.”
>
>“Einstein’s conception is closer to mine. His God is somehow involved in the immutable laws of nature. Einstein has a feeling for the central order of things. He can detect it in the simplicity of natural laws. We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity. Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don’t believe Einstein is to tied to any religious tradition, and I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him. But as far as he is concerned there is no split between science and religion: the central order is part of the subjective as well as the objective realm, and this strikes me as being a far better starting point.”
>
>“A start point for what?” I asked. “If you consider man’s attitude to the central order a purely personal matter, then you may agree with Einstein’s view, but then you must also concede that nothing at all follows from this view.”
>
>“Perhaps it does,” Wolfgang replied. “The development of science during the past two centuries has certainly changed man’s thinking, even outside the Christian West.” […]
>
>Paul Dirac had joined us in the meantime. He had only just turned twenty-five, and had little time for tolerance. “I don’t know why we are talking about religion,” he objected. “If we are honest – and scientists have to be – we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can’t for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way.” […]
>
>“You are simply judging religion by its political abuses,” I objected. […] “After all, there will always be human societies, and these must find a common language in which they can speak about life and death, and about the wider context in which their lives are set. The spiritual forms that have developed historically out of this search for a common language must have had a great persuasive force – how else could so many people have lived by them for so many centuries? Religion can’t be dismissed as simply as all that. But perhaps you are drawn to another religion, such as the old Chinese, in which the idea of a personal God does not occur?”
>
>“I dislike religious myths on principle,” Dirac replied, “if only because the myths of the different religions contradict one another. After all, it was purely by chance that I was born in Europe and not in Asia, and that is surely no criterion for judging what is true or what I ought to believe. And I can only believe what is true.” […]
>
>And so the discussion continued, and we were all of us surprised to notice that Wolfgang was keeping so silent. He would pull a long face or smile rather maliciously from time to time, but he said nothing. In the end, we had to ask him to tell us what he thought. He seemed a little surprised and then said: “Well, our friend Dirac, too, has a religion, and its guiding principle is: ‘There is no God and Dirac is His prophet.’ ” We all laughed, including Dirac, and this brought our evening in the hotel lounge to a close.
>
>Some time later, probably in Copenhagen, I told Niels [Bohr] about our conversation. He immediately jumped to the defense of the youngest member of our circle. “I consider it marvelous,” he said, “that Paul should be so uncompromising in his defense of all that can be expressed in clear and logical language. He believes that what can be said at all can be said clearly – or, as Wittgenstein put it, that ‘whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.’ […] I feel very much like Dirac: the idea of a personal God is foreign to me. But we ought to remember that religion uses language in quite a different way from science. The language of religion is more closely related to the language of poetry than to the language of science. True, we are inclined to think that science deals with information about objective facts, and poetry with subjective feelings. Hence we conclude that if religion does indeed deal with objective truths, it ought to adopt the same criteria of truth as science. But I myself find the division of the world into an objective and a subjective side much too arbitrary. The fact that religions through the ages have spoken in images, parables, and paradoxes means simply that there are no other way of grasping the reality to which they refer. But that does not mean that it is not a genuine reality. And splitting this reality into an objective and subjective side won’t get us very far.
>
>“That is why I consider those developments in physics during the last decades which have shown how problematical such concepts as ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ are, a great liberation of thought. […] Naturally, it sill makes no difference whether the observer is a man, an animal, or a piece of apparatus, but it is no longer possible to make predictions without reference to the observer or the means of observation. To that extent, every physical process may be said to have objective and subjective features. The objective world of nineteenth-century science was, as we know today, an ideal, limiting case, but not the whole reality. Admittedly, even in our future encounters with reality we shall have to distinguish between the objective and the subjective side, to make a division between the two. But the location of the separation may depend on the way things are looked at; to a certain extent it can be chosen at will. Hence I can quite understand why we cannot speak about the content of religion in an objectifying language. The fact that different religions try to express this content in quite distinct spiritual forms is no real objection. Perhaps we ought to look upon these different forms as complementary description which, though they exclude one another, are needed to convey the rich possibilities flowing from man’s relationship with the central order.”
>
>“If you distinguish so sharply between the languages of religion, science, and art,” I asked, “what meaning do you attach to such apodictic statements as ‘There is a living God’ or ‘There is an immortal soul’? What is the meaning of ‘there is’ in this type of language? Science, like Dirac, objects to such formulations. […] Mathematics introduces ever high stages of abstraction that help us attain a coherent grasp of ever wider realms. To get back to our original question, it is correct to look upon the religious ‘there is’ as just another, though different, attempts to reach every high levels of abstraction? An attempt to facilitate our understanding of universal connections? After all, the connections themselves are real enough, no matter into what spiritual forms we try to fit them.”
>
>“With respect to the epistemological side of the problem, your comparison may pass,” Bohr replied. “But in other respects it is quite inadequate. In mathematics we can take our inner distance from the content of our statements. In the final analysis mathematics is a mental game that we can play or not play as we choose. Religion, on the other hand, deals with ourselves, with our life and death; its promises are meant to govern our actions and thus, at least indirectly, our very existence. We cannot just look at them impassively from the outside. Moreover, our attitude to religious questions cannot be separated from our attitude to society. […] Religion helps to make social life more harmonious; its most important task is to remind us, in the language of pictures and parables, of the wider framework within which our life is set.”
>
>“You keep referring to the individual’s free choice,” I said, “and you compare it with the freedom with which the atomic physicist can arrange his experiments in this way or that. Now the classical physicists had no such freedom. Does that mean that the special features of modern physics have a more direct bearing on the problem of the freedom of the will? As you know, the fact that atomic processes cannot be fully determined is often used as an argument in favor of free will and divine intervention.”
>
>“I am convinced that this whole attitude is based on a simple misunderstanding, or rather on the confusion of questions, which, as far as I can see, impinge on distinct though complementary ways of looking at things. If we speak of free will, we refer to a situation in which we have to make decisions. This situation and the one in which we analyze the motives of our actions or even the one in which we study physiological processes, for instance the electrochemical processes in our brain, are mutually exclusive. In other words, they are complementary, so that the question whether natural laws determine events completely or only statistically has no direct bearing on the question of free will. Naturally, our different ways of looking at things must fit together in the long run, i.e., we must be able to recognize them as noncontradictory parts of the same reality, though we cannot yet tell precisely how. When we speak of divine intervention, we quite obviously do not refer to the scientific determination of an event, but to the meaningful connection between this event and others or human thought. Now this intellectual connection is as much a part of reality as scientific causality; it would be much too crude a simplification if we ascribed it exclusively to the subjective side of reality.” […]
>
>“We always come back to the epistemological side of religion,” I objected. “But Dirac’s attack on religion was aimed chiefly at its ethical side. Dirac disapproves quite particularly of the dishonesty and self-deception that are far too often coupled to religious thought. But in his abhorrence he has become a fanatic defender of rationalism, and I have the feeling that rationalism is not enough.”
