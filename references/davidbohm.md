## The undivided universe: an ontological interpretation of quantum theory <a name="arkhe"></a>
*Routledge, 1993*

### Chapter 1, introduction [p. 1]
>The formalism of the quantum theory leads to results that agree with experiment with great accuracy and covers an extremely wide range of phenomena. As yet there are no experimental indications of any domain in which it might break down. Nevertheless, there still remain a number of basic questions concerning its fundamental significance which are obscure and confused. Thus for example one of the leading physicists of our time, M. Gell-Mann, has said “Quantum mechanics, that mysterious, confusing discipline, which none of us really understands but which we know how to use”.
>
>Just what the points are that are not clear, will be specified in detail throughout this books […]. We can however outline a few of them here in a preliminary way.
>
>- Though the quantum theory treats statistical ensembles in a satisfactory way, we are unable to describe individual quantum processes without bringing in unsatisfactory assumptions, such as the collapse of the wave function.
>- There is by now the well-known nonlocality that has been brought out by Bell in connection with the EPR experiment.
>- There is the mysterious ‘wave-particle duality’ in the properties of matter that is demonstrated in a quantum interference experiment.
>- Above all, there is the inability to give a clear notion of what the reality of a quantum system could be.
>
>All that is clear about the quantum theory is that it contains an algorithm for computing the probabilities of experimental results. But it gives no physical account of individual quantum processes. Indeed, without the measuring instruments in which the predicted results appear, the equations of the quantum theory would be just pure mathematics that would have no physical meaning at all. And thus quantum theory merely gives us (generally statistical) knowledge of how our instruments will function. And from this we can make inferences that contribute to our knowledge, for example, of how to carry out various technical processes. That is to say, it seems, as indeed Bohr and Heisenberg have implied, that quantum theory is concerned only with our knowledge of reality and especially of how to predict and control the behaviour of this reality, at least as far as this may be possible. Or to put it in more philosophical terms, it may be said that quantum theory is primarily directed towards epistemology which is the study that focuses on the question of how we obtain our knowledge (and possibly on what we can do with it).
>
>It follows from this that quantum mechanics can say little or nothing about reality itself. In philosophical terminology, it does not give what can be called an ontology for a quantum system. Ontology is concerned primarily with that which is and only secondarily with how we obtain our knowledge about this (in the sense, for example, that the process of observation would be treated as an interaction between the observed system and the observing apparatus regarded as existing together in a way that does not depend significantly on whether these are known or not).
>
>We have chosen as the subtitle of our book “An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory” because it gives the clearest and most accurate description of what the book is about. The original papers in which the ideas were first proposed were entitled “An Interpretation in Terms of Hidden Variables” and later they were referred to as a “Causal Interpretation”. However, we now feel that these terms are too restrictive. First the concept that the electron is a particle with well-defined position and momentum that is, however, profoundly affected by a wave that always accompanies it. Far from being hidden, this particle is generally what is most directly manifested in an observation. The only point is that its properties cannot be observed with complete precision (within the limits set by the uncertainty principle). Nor is this sort of theory necessarily causal. For, as shown in chapter 9, we can also have a stochastic version of our ontological interpretation. The question of determinism is therefore a secondary one, while the primary question is whether we can have an adequate conception of the reality of a quantum system, be this causal or be it stochastic or be it of any other nature.
>
>In chapter 14 section 14.2 we explain our general attitude to determinism in more detail, but the main point that is relevant here is that we regard all theories as approximations with limited domains of validity. Some theories may be more nearly determinate, while others are less so. The way is open for the constant discovery of new theories, but ultimately these must be related coherently. However, there is no reason to suppose that physical theory is steadily approaching some final truth. It is always open (as has indeed generally been the case) that new theories will have a qualitatively different content within which the older theories may be seen to fit together, perhaps in some approximate way. Since there is no final theory, it cannot be said that the universe is either ultimately deterministic or ultimately indeterministic. Therefore we cannot from physical theories alone draw any conclusions, for example, about the ultimate limits of human freedom.
>
>It will be shown throughout this book that our interpretation gives a coherent treatment of the entire domain covered by the quantum theory. This means that it is able to lead to the same statistical results as do other generally accepted interpretations. In particular these include the Bohr interpretation and variations on this which we shall discuss in chapter 2 (e.g. the interpretations of von Neumann and Wigner). For the sake of convenience we shall put these altogether and call them the conventional interpretation.
>
>Although our main objective in this book is to show that we can give an ontological explanation of the same domain that is covered by the conventional interpretation, we do show in the last two chapters how it is possible in our approach to extend the theory in new ways implying new experimental consequences that go beyond the current quantum theory. Such new theories could be tested only if we could find some domain in which the quantum theory actually breaks down. In the last two chapters we sketch some new theories of this kind and indicate some areas in which one may expect the quantum theory to break down in a way that will allow for a test.
>
>Partly because it has not generally been realised that our interpretation has such new possibilities, the objection has been raised that is has no real content of its own and that it merely recasts the content of the conventional interpretation in a different language. Critics therefore ask: “If this is the case, why should we consider this interpretation at all?”
>
>We can answer this objection on several levels. Firstly we make the general point that the above argument could be turned the other way round. Thus de Broglie proposed very early what is, in essence, the germ of our approach. But this met intense opposition from leading physicists of the day. This was especially manifest at the Solvay Congress of 1927. This opposition was continued later when in 1952 one of us proposed an extension of the theory which answered all the objections and indeed encouraged de Broglie to take up his ideas again. […]
>
>Let us suppose however that the Solvay Congress had gone the other way and that de Broglie’s ideas had eventually been adopted and developed. What then would have happened, if 25 years later some physicists had come along and had proposed the current interpretation (which is at present the conventional one)? Clearly by then there would be a large number of physicists trained in the de Broglie interpretation and these would have found it difficult to change. They would naturally have asked: “What do we concretely gain if we do change, if after all the results are the same?” the proponents of the suggested ‘new’ approach would then probably have argued that there were nevertheless some subtle gains that it is difficult to weigh concretely. This is the kind of answer that we are giving now to this particular criticism of our own interpretation. To fail to consider such an answer seriously is equivalent to the evidently specious argument that the interpretation that “gets in there first” is the one that should always prevail.
>
>Let us then consider what we regard as the main advantages of our interpretation. Firstly, as we shall explain in more detail throughout the book but especially in chapters 13, 14 and 15, it provides an intuitive grasp of the whole process. This makes the theory much more intelligible than using these equations to determine the probable outcomes of experiments. Even though many physicists feel that making such calculations is basically what physics is all about, it is our view that the intuitive and imaginative side which makes the whole theory intelligible is as important in the long run as is the side of mathematical calculation.
>
>Secondly, as we shall see in chapter 8, our interpretation can be shown to contain a classical limit within it which follows in a natural way from the theory itself without the need for any special assumptions. On the other hand, in the conventional interpretation, it is necessary to presuppose a classical level before the quantum theory can have any meaning. The correspondence principle then demonstrates the consistency of the quantum theory with this presupposition. But this does not change the fact that without presupposing a classical level there no way even to talk about the measuring instruments that are essential in this interpretation to give the quantum theory a meaning.
>
>Because of the need to presuppose the classical level (and perhaps eventually an observer), there is no way in the conventional interpretation to give a consistent account of quantum cosmology. For, as this interpretation now stands, it is always necessary to assume an observer (or his proxy in the form of an instrument) which is not contained in the theory itself. If this theory is intended to apply cosmologically, it is evidently necessary that we should not, from the very outset, assume essential elements that are not capable of being included in the theory. Our interpretation does not suffer from this difficulty because the classical level flows out of the theory itself and does not have to be presupposed from outside.
>
>Finally as we have already pointed out our approach has the potentiality for extension to new theories with new experimental consequences that go beyond the quantum theory.
>
>However, because our interpretation and the many others that have been proposed lead, at least for the present, to the same predictions for the experimental results, there is no way experimentally to decide between them. Arguments may be made in favour or against any of them on various bases, which include not only those that we have given here, but also questions of beauty, elegance, simplicity and economy of hypotheses. However, these latter are somewhat subjective and depend not only on the particular tastes of the individual, but also on socially adopted conventions, consensual opinions and many other such factors which are ultimately imponderable and which can be argued many ways. […]
>
>We then come to the final part of the book which is concerned with various other ontological interpretations that have been proposed and with modifications of the quantum theory that are possible in terms of these interpretations. The first of these is the many-worlds interpretation which has recently aroused the interest of people working in cosmology. We begin by pointing out that there is as yet no generally agreed version of this interpretation and that there are two different bodies of opinion about it. One of these starts from Everett’s approach and the other from DeWitt’s. Though these are frequently regarded as the same, we show that there are important differences of principle between them. We discuss these differences in some detail and also the as yet not entirely successful efforts of other workers in the field to deal with the unresolved problems in these two approaches. Finally we make a comparison between our interpretation and the many-worlds point of view.
>
>The many-worlds interpretation was not explicitly aimed at going beyond the limits of the current quantum theory. In chapter 14 we discuss theories that introduce concepts that do go beyond the current quantum theory, at least in principle. The first of these is the theory of Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber who propose nonlinear, nonlocal modifications of Schrödinger’s equation that would cause the wave function actually to collapse. The modifications are so arranged that the collapse process is significant only for large scale systems containing many particles, while for systems containing only a few particles, the results are the same, for all practical purposes, as those of the current linear and local form of Schrödinger’s equation.
>
>Even more striking changes are proposed by Stapp and by Gell-Mann and Hartle, the latter of whom develop their ideas in considerable detail. They deal with the whole question cosmologically from the very outset by introducing mathematical concepts that enable them to describe actual histories of processes taking place in cosmos, from the beginning of the universe to the end.
>
>We give a careful analysis of these approaches. Both of them aim to do what the many-worlds interpretation has not yet succeeded in doing adequately, i.e., to show that the quantum theory contains a ‘classical world’ within it. While they have gone some way towards this goal, it becomes clear that there are still unresolved problems standing in the way of its achievement.
>
>We also give a critical comparison between their approach and ours, pointing out that their histories actually involve a mathematical assumption analogous to that involved in the notion of particles in our interpretation. Therefore it is not basically a question of the number of assumptions. Rather, we suggest that the main advantage claimed over ours, at least implicitly, is that it expressed all concepts in terms of Hilbert space, whereas we introduce a notion of particles that goes outside this framework.
>
>Finally we discuss some proposals of our own going beyond the quantum theory. Basically these are an extension of what we suggested in chapter 1. The idea is that there will be a stochastic sub-quantum and sub­-relativistic level in which the current laws of physics will fail. This will probably first be encountered near the Planck length of 10e-33 cm. However, over longer distances our stochastic interpretation of relativistic quantum theory will be recovered as a limiting case, but as we have suggested earlier, experiments involving shorter times could reveal significant differences from the predictions of the current relativistic quantum theory.
>
>Up to this point we have, in a certain sense, been discussion in the traditional Cartesian framework even though many new concepts have been introduced within this framework. In chapter 15, the final chapter of the book, we introduce a radically new overall framework which we call the implicate or enfolded order. In this chapter we shall give a sketch of these ideas which are in any case only in early stages of development.
>
>We being by showing that the failure of quantum theory and relativity to cohere conceptually already beings to point to the need for such a new order for physics as a whole. We then introduce the implicate order and explain it in terms of a number of examples which illustrate the enfoldment of a whole structure into each region of space, e.g. as happens in a hologram. We show that the notion of order based on such an enfoldment gives an accurate and intuitive grasp of the meaning of the propagator function of quantum mechanics and, more generally, of Hilbert space itself. We indicate how this notion is contained mathematically in an algebra which is essentially the algebra of quantum mechanics itself.
>
>These ideas are connected with our ontological interpretation by means of a model of a particle as a sequence of incoming and outgoing waves, with successive waves very close to each other. For longer times, this approximates our stochastic trajectories, while for shorter times it leads to a very new concept. What is to be emphasized here is that in this way our trajectory model can be incorporated into the framework of Hilbert space. When this is done, we see that it is part of a larger set of possible theories which include those of Stapp and Gell-Mann and Hartle.
>
>One of the main new ideas implied by this approach is that the geometry and the dynamics have to be in the same framework, i.e. that of the implicate order. In this way we come to a deep unity between quantum theory and geometry in which each is seen to be inherently conformable to the other. We therefore do not begin with traditional Cartesian notions of order and then try to impose the dynamics of quantum theory on the order by using the algorithm of ‘quantisation’. Rather quantum theory and geometry are united from the very outset and are seen to emerge together from what may be called pre-space.
>
>Finally we discuss certain analogies between the implicate order and consciousness and suggest an approach in which the physical and the mental sides would be two aspects of a greater order in which they are inherently related.

### Chapter 2, ontological versus epistemological interpretations of the quantum theory [p. 13]

>In classical physics there was never a serious problem either about the ontology, or about the epistemology. With regard to the ontology, one assumed the existence of particles and fields which were taken to be essentially independent of the human observer. The epistemology was then almost self-evident because the observing apparatus was supposed to obey the same objective laws as the observed system, so that the measurement process could be understood as a special case of the general laws applying to the entire universe.
>
>As we already brought out in chapter 1, in quantum mechanics this simple approach to ontology and epistemology was found to be no longer applicable. In the present chapter we shall go into this question in more detail especially in connection with the way this subject is treated in the conventional interpretation.
>
>Let us begin with the fact that quantum mechanics was introduced as an essentially statistical theory. Of course statistical theories in general are capable of being given a straightforward ontological interpretation, for example, in terms of an objective stochastic process. The epistemology could then be worked out along the same lines as for a deterministic theory such as classical mechanics. But Bohr and Heisenberg raised further questions about the validity of such an approach in the quantum theory. Their argument was based on two postulates: (a) the indivisibility of the quantum of action and (b) the unpredictability and uncontrollability of its consequences in each individual case.
>
>It follows from the above assumptions, as we shall show in more detail presently, that in the measurement of p and x, for example, there is a maximum possible accuracy given by the uncertainty principle ΔpΔx > h. This is clearly a limitation on the possible accuracy and relevance of our knowledge of the observed system. However, this has been taken on as a purely epistemological limitation on our knowledge but also as an ontological limitation on the possibility of defining the state of being of the observed system itself. […]
>
>Relationships of this kind implied, for Heisenberg and Bohr, that the basic properties of the particle, i.e. its position and momentum, are not merely uncertain to us, but rather that there is no way to give them a meaning beyond the limit set by Heisenberg’s principle. They inferred from this that there is, as we have already pointed out, an inherent ambiguity in the state of being of the particle. And this in turn implied that, at the quantum level of accuracy, there is no way to say what the electron is and it does, such concepts being applicable approximately only in the classical (correspondence) limit.
>
>This evidently represented a totally new situation in physics and Bohr felt that what was called for was a correspondingly new way of describing an experiment in which the entire phenomenon was regarded a single and unanalyzable whole. […]
>
>One has at most an unambiguous classical ontology and the quantum theory is reflected in this ontology by requiring basic concepts such a p and x to be ambiguous. One might perhaps suppose that there could be some unambiguous deeper quantum concepts of a new kind. But Bohr would say there is no way to relate these definitely to what we ordinarily regard as objective reality, i.e. the domain in which classical physics is a good approximation. Folse has made it clear that Bohr is not simply a positivist, but that the notion of some kind of independent physical reality underlies all his thinking.
>
>We can summarise Bohr’s position as saying that all physical concepts must correspond to phenomenon, i.e. appearances. Each phenomenon is an abstraction. This is also true classically. But because the correspondence between the phenomenon and the independent reality which underlies it may, in principle, be unambiguous, and because all the phenomena are mutually compatible, we may say that the independent reality can be reflected completely in the whole set of phenomena. This means in effect that we can know the independent reality itself. But quantum mechanically we cannot apply all relevant abstractions together in an unambiguous way and therefore whatever we say about independent reality is only implicit in this way of using concepts.
>
>What then is the meaning of the mathematics of the quantum theory (which is very well defined indeed)? Bohr describes this as the quantum algorithm which gives the probabilities of the possible results for each kind of experimental arrangement. Clearly this means that the mathematics must not be regarded as reflecting an independent quantum reality that is well defined, but rather that it constitutes in essence only knowledge about the statistics of the quantum phenomena.
>
>All this, as we have already pointed out, is a consequence of the indivisibility of the quantum of action which is very well verified experimentally. Bohr therefore does not regard his notion of complementary as based on philosophical assumptions. Rather it has for him an ontological significance in the sense that it says something about reality, i.e. that it is ambiguously related to the phenomena. He would probably say that attempts to define the ontology in more detail would be contradictory.
>
>Bohr’s view seems to have had a very widespread influence, but his ideas do not appear to have been well understood by the majority of physicists. Rather the latter generally thought in terms of a different approach along lines initiated by Dirac, and von Neumann, in which the concept of a quantum state played a key role (whereas with Bohr this concept was hardly even mentioned and was certainly not a fundamental part of his ideas).
>
>To understand what is meant by a quantum state we can begin with Dirac’s notion that each physical quantity is represented by an Hermitian operation which is called an observable. When this is measured by a suitable apparatus the system is left with a wave function corresponding to an eigenfunction of this observable. In general such a measurement will, in agreement with Heisenberg’s principle, alter this wave function in an uncontrollable and unpredictable way. […]
>
>Once we obtain such an eigenfunction we can measure the same observable again and again, in principle, in a time so short that the wave function does not change significantly (except for a phase factor which is not relevant). Each measurement will then reproduce the same result. In terms of the ‘naive’ ontology that pervades ordinary experience, this leads one to suppose that, between measurements of the same observable, the system continues to exist with the same wave function ψn (again, except for a phase factor). Therefore one could say that during this time the system is in a certain state of being, i.e. it stands independently of its being observed. Of course, this state might change in longer times of its own accord and, in addition, it would also change if a different observable were measured.
>
>In contrast, Bohr would never allow the type of language that admitted the independent existence of any kind of quantum object which could be said to be in a certain state. That is to say, he would not regard it as meaningful to talk about, for example, a particle existing between quantum measurements even if the same results were obtained for a given observable in a sequence of such measurements. Rather, as we have seen, he considered the experimental arrangement and the content (meaning) of the result to be a single unanalyzable whole. To talk of a state in abstraction from such an experimental arrangement would, for Bohr, make no sense.
>
>This general point can be clarified by considering what is in essence an intermediate approach adopted by Heisenberg. Though, this point of view was indeed proposed earlier by Bohm. He suggested that the wave function represented, not an actual reality, but rather a set of potentialities that could be realised according to the experimental conditions. A helpful analogy may be obtained by considering a seed, which is evidently not an actual plant, but which determines potentialities for realizing various possible forms of the plant according to conditions of soil, rain, sunlight, wind, etc. Thus when the measurement of a given observable was repeated, this would correspond to a plant producing a seed, which growing under the same conditions, produced the same form of plant again (so that there was no continuously existent plant). Measurement of another observable would correspond to changing the experimental conditions, and this could produce a statistical range of possible plants of different forms. Returning to the quantum theory, it is clear that in this approach the apparatus is regarded as actually helping to ‘create’ the observed results.
>
>It must be emphasized, however, that Bohr specifically rejected this suggestion which he probably felt gave too much independent reality to whatever is supposed to be represented by the wave function. (As we recall he regarded this as only part of a calculus for predicting the statistics of experimental results.) Thus he states “I warned especially against phrases, often found in the physical literature, such as ‘disturbing of phenomena by observation’ or ‘creating physical attributes to atomic objects by measurement’. Such phrases are … apt to cause confusion, …”. Bohr is evidently saying here essentially what we have said before, i.e. that for him it has no meaning to talk of a quantum object with its attributes apart from the unanalyzable whole phenomenon in which it is actually observed.
>
>It is thus clear, as we have indeed already pointed out earlier, that Bohr’s objection to the potentiality approach, as well as to taking the concept of quantum state too literally, does not represent for him a purely philosophical question. Indeed in his discussion of the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen experiment [EPR], it was just this point that was crucial in his answer to the challenge presented by EPR. As we shall show in more detail in chapter 7, Bohr would say that the EPR paradox was based on an inadmissible attribution of properties to a second particle solely on the basis of measurements that could be carried out on the first particle.
>
>It is clear then that there is an important distinction between Bohr’s approach and that of Heisenberg with his notion of potentiality, and perhaps an even greater difference from that of most physicists, who give a basic significance to the concept of quantum state. This notion of quantum state has indeed been most systematically and extensively developed by von Neumann, who not only gave it a precise mathematical formulation, but who also attempted, in his own way, to come to grips with the philosophical issues to which this approach gave rise.
>
>It was a key part of this development to give a proof claiming to show that quantum mechanics had an intrinsic logical closure (in the sense, that no further concepts, e.g. involving ‘hidden variables’, could be introduced that would make possible a more detailed description of the state of the system than is afforded by the wave function). On this basis he concluded that the wave function yielded the most complete possible description of what we have been calling quantum reality, which is thus totally contained in the concept of a quantum state.
>
>In order to clarify the physical meaning of these notions he developed a more detailed theory of measurements. This theory still have a basic significance to epistemology because the only meaning attributed to the wave function was that it gave probabilities for the results of possible measurements (i.e. it did not begin with the assumption of an independently existing universe that would have meaning apart from the process in which its properties were measured). Nevertheless this theory gave more significance to ontology than Bohr did because it assumed the quantum system existed in a certain quantum state.
>
>This state could only be manifested in phenomena at a large scale (classical) level. Thus he was led to make a distinction between the quantum and the classical levels. Between them, he said there was a ‘cut’. This is of course, purely abstract because von Neumann admitted, along with physicists in general, that the quantum and classical levels had to exist in what was basically one world. However, for the sake of analysis one could talk about these two different levels and treat them as being in interaction. The effect of this interaction was to produce at the classical level a certain observable experimental result. […] Reciprocally, this interaction produced an effect on the quantum level; that is, the wave function changed from its original form ψ to ψn, where n is the actual result of the measurement obtained at the classical level. This change has been described as a ‘collapse’ of the wave function. Such a collapse would violate Schrödinger’s equation, which must hold for any quantum system. However, this does not seem to have disturbed von Neumann unduly, probably because one could think that in its interaction with the classical level such a system need not satisfy the laws that apply when it is isolated.
>
>One difficulty with this theory is that the location of the cut between quantum and classical level is to a large extent arbitrary. For example, one may include the apparatus and the observed object as part of a single combined system, which is to be treated quantum mechanically. We then observe this combined system with the aid of yet another apparatus which is, however, treated as being in the classical level. The ‘cut’ has then been moved to some point between the first apparatus and the second. […]
>
>In a ‘naive’ view of this process, one could readily say that this collapse represented merely an improvement of our knowledge of the state of the system which resulted from its being measured by the second apparatus. Indeed in the application of classical probability in physics such ‘collapses’ are quite common. […]
>
>But this interpretation is not valid here because in the classical situation we have a linear combination of probabilities of each of the results, whereas quantum mechanically we have a linear combination of wave functions, while the probability depends quadratically on these wave functions. […]
>
>This difficulty arises in essence because von Neumann introduced the basically ontological notion that the wave function represents a quantum state that somehow ‘stands on its own’ (although, of course, in interaction with the classical level). Bohr avoids this problem by never speaking of a quantum object that could stand on its own, but rather by speaking only of a phenomenon which is an unanalyzable whole. The question of interaction between a quantum level and a classical level thus cannot arise. Therefore in this sense, he is more consistent than von Neumann.
>
>At first sight one might be inclined to regard these questions as not very important. For after all the cut is only an abstraction and one can see that the statistical results do not depend on where it is placed. However, in so far as von Neumann effectively gave the quantum state a certain ontological significance, the net result was to produce a confused and unsatisfactory ontology. This ontology is such as to imply that the collapse of the wave function must also have an ontological significance (whereas for Bohr it merely represents a feature of the quantum algorithm which arises in the treatment of a new experiment). To show the extent of this difficulty, one could, for example, introduce a third apparatus that would measure a system that consisted of the observed object and the first two pieces of apparatus. For this situation the collapse would take place between the second and third piece of apparatus. One could go on with this sort of sequence indefinitely to include, for example, a computer recording of the results on a disc. In this case the collapse would take place when the disc was read, perhaps even a year or so later. (In which case the whole system would be in a certain quantum state represented by a linear combination of wave functions over this whole period of time.) And, as von Neumann himself pointed out, one could even include parts of the human brain within the total quantum system, so that the collapse could be brought about as a function of the brain.
>
>It is evident that this whole situation is unsatisfactory because the ontological process of collapse is itself highly ambiguous. Perhaps Bohr’s rather more limited ambiguity may seem preferable to von Neumann’s indefinitely proliferating ambiguity.
>
>Wigner has carried this argument further and has suggested that the above ambiguity of the collapse can be removed by assuming that this process is definitely a consequence of the interaction of matter and mind. Thus he is, in effect, placing the cut between these two and implying that mind is not limited by quantum theory. (Pauli has also felt for different reasons that mind plays a key role in this context).
>
>We can see several difficulties in the attempt to bring in the direct action of the mind to give an ontological interpretation of the current physical laws of the quantum theory. Thus in a laboratory, it is hard to believe that the human mind is actually significantly affecting the results of the functioning of the instruments (which may, as we have already pointed out, be recorded on a computer that is not even examined for a long time). Moreover quantum theory is currently applied to cosmology, and it is difficult to believe that the evolution of the universe before the appearance of human beings depended fundamentally on the human mind (e.g. to make its wave function ‘collapse’ in an appropriate way). Of course one could avoid this difficulty by assuming a universal mind. But if we know little about the human mind, we know a great deal less about the universal mind. Such an assumption replaces one mystery by an even greater one.
>
>One may ask why physicists have felt the need to bring in mind in their attempts to make sense of the quantum theory. Such a need is, indeed, implied in the work of those following along the lines of von Neumann. These want to say that the wave function has an ontological significance, i.e. as representing the quantum state, and at the same time to assume that it is a complete description of reality. However, as we have already pointed out, Bohr has claimed (apparently with greater consistency) that any ontology whatsoever is ruled out by the very nature of reality as revealed throughout the quantum theory. This would suggest that it would be better to adopt Bohr’s point of view.
>
>But does the fact that the quantum theory has been applied so successfully lead inevitably to Bohr’s conclusion concerning the nature of reality? Clearly it does not. For as we have already explained, it involves certain assumptions about real physical processes. In order to examine these assumptions properly, let us repeat them. Firstly the quantum of action is taken to be indivisible and secondly it is assumed to be unpredictable and uncontrollable. From this, Bohr draws the conclusion that the state of being is inherently ambiguous at the quantum level of accuracy.
>
>It is essential to look more carefully at this conclusion which is based, in part, on a tacit identification of determinism with predictability and controllability. This identification is clearly characteristic of positivist philosophy. In this philosophy, science is not regarded as dealing with what is, so that concepts cannot be regarded as reflecting reality. Rather that have to be defined empirically, i.e. in relation to their manifestation in observation and experience. In such a philosophy it follows that determinism can have no meaning beyond predictability and controllability.
>
>Since the quantum theory was first formulated, the relationship of determinism to predictability and controllability has been clarified by the discovery that a very general class of deterministic systems (i.e. those having unstable and chaotic motions) are neither predictable nor controllable, as has been discussed in some detail by Penrose. Thus the identification of determinism with predictability and controllability has been invalidated. It follows that the mere uncontrollability and unpredictability of quantum phenomena does not necessarily imply that there can be no quantum world, which could in itself be determinate.
>
>What about the indivisibility and unanalysability of the quantum of action? It is true that in some sense, at least, the quantum of action is neither divisible nor analyzable at the level of the phenomena. Consider, for example, an atom emitting a quantum of light. We have two distinct states (a) The atom is an excited state and no quantum present. And (b) the atom in its ground state and a quantum present.

>The process of going from (a) to (b) is said to be a ‘quantum jump’ in the sense that there are no phenomena which correspond to any state in between. Of course, we may try to find such phenomena by observing the system in its process of transition. But as implied in Bohr’s views, this would constitute an entirely different experimental arrangement that would be incompatible with the process of transition that we are considering.
>
>From this however it does not follow that there is no more complete description perhaps at a deeper more complex level in which this process can be treated as continuous and analyzable. Once can indeed easily conceive of such a process in general terms. For example, the same kind of non-linear equations that give rise to unstable and chaotic motions can also lead to what are called stable limit cycles in which the system stays near a certain state of motion. But more generally this stability may be limited so that the system can ‘jump’ from one such limit cycle to another, in a movement so fast and unstable that it could neither be predicted, controlled nor followed. Thus it would not appear in the phenomena. Indeed as we shall see in chapter 5, our interpretation of the quantum theory implied just such ‘jumps’ between what are in essence stable limit cycles. In this way one may explain processes that in the quantum theory are called “unpredictable, uncontrollable and indivisible quantum transitions between discrete orbits”.
>
>But as we recall, Bohr’s entire position depended crucially on his assumptions of the nature of the quantum of action. Therefore from what we have said above it follows that there is no inherent necessity to adopt Bohr’s position, and that there is nothing in Bohr’s analysis that could rule out a quantum ontology. But of course, this latter would require the introduction of new concepts beyond that of the wave function and the quantum state. We should have to begin by simply assuming the new concepts and defining them through their participation in the laws of physics.
>
>In doing this we have to differ from Bohr who at least tacitly required that all basic physical concepts be defined by referring them to specific phenomena in which they are measured. In contrast we derive the possible phenomena as forms on the overall structure of concepts and their relationships. An example of this is given by Einstein’s derivation of particles obeying the usual laws of motion, either as singularities, or as very strong static pulses in a continuous non-linear field. The test of the theory is then to see whether the derived phenomena, not only explain the general form of the observed phenomena, but also their detailed relationships. In such an approach, the epistemology follows naturally from the ontology (just as it does in classical physics).
>
>At this point, however, we have to return to von Neumann who, as we have already pointed out, believed that the wave function contained the most complete possible description of reality, thus implying that there was no way to do what we have suggested above. Von Neumann based this belief on his theorem to which we have alluded earlier, that claimed to show that a more detailed description would not be compatible with the laws of the quantum theory. This proof was however questioned by Bohm in 1952 and later by Bell. A number of those who followed along von Neumann’s lines, refined his arguments in several ways, but these refinements were also shown by Bell to make tacit assumptions about ontological theories that are too limited). […]
>
>We conclude that there are no sound reasons against seeking an ontological interpretation of the quantum theory. This book presents in essence the first complete ontological interpretation that has been proposed. As indicated in the introduction, there have been several other ontological interpretations since then.

### Chapter 3, causal interpretation of the one-body system [p. 31]

>At first sight it may seem that to consider the electron, for example, as some kind of particle that is affected by the quantum field is just a return to older classical ideas. Such a notion is however generally felt to have long since been proved to be inadequate in understanding quantum theory which possesses so many features that are very different from those of classical mechanics. However, closer inspection shows that we are not actually reducing quantum mechanics in this way to an explanation in termes of classical ideas. For the quantum potential has a number of strikingly new features which do not cohere with what is generally accepted as the ssential structure of classical physics.
>
>In this connection it is important to note that the form of Newton’s laws alone is not enough to determine that the general structure of classical physics shall hold. For example, a great deal of work has been done showing that to obtain determinism (which is surely an essential feature of classical physics) we require further assumptions on the nature of the forces. For example, if infinite particle velocities or signal velocities are allowed, it has been demonstrated that determinism may fail. But no one has claimed to have given an exhaustive treatment of all the requirements even for determinism alone. Moreover it seems reasonable to suppose that other features of classical physics may also depend on further (largely tacit) assumptions about the nature of the forces. Indeed as we shall see, the new qualitative features of the quantum potential that we have mentioned above are just such as to imply the new properties of matter that are revealed by the quantum theory.
>
>The first of these new properties can be seen by noting that the quantum potential is not changed when we multiply the field by an arbitrary constant. […] This means that the effect of the quantum potential is independent of the strength (i.e. the intensity) of the quantum field but depends only on its form. By contrast, classical waves, which act mechanically (i.e. to transfer energy and momentum, for example, to push a floating object), always produce effects that are more or less proportional to the strength of the wave. For example one may consider a water wave which causes a cork to bob. The further the cork is from the centre of the wave the less it will move. But with the quantum field, it is as if the cork could bob with full strength even far from the source of the wave.
>
>Such behaviour would seem strange from the point of view of classical physics. Yet it is fairly common at the level of ordinary experience. For example we may consider a ship on automatic pilot being guided by radio waves. Here, too, the effect of the radio waves is independent of their intensity and depends only on their form. The essential point is that the ship is moving with its own energy, and that the form of the radio waves is taken up to direct the much greater energy of the ship. We may therefore propose than an electron too moves under its own energy, and that the form of the quantum wave directs the energy of the electron.
>
>This introduces several features into the movement. First of all, it means that particles moving in empty space under the action of no classical forces need not travel uniformly in straight lines. This is a radical departure from classical Newtonian theory. Moreover, since the effect of the wave does not necessarily fall off with the distance, even remote features of the environment can profoundly affect the movement. […]
>
>In this explanation of the quantum properties of the electron, the fact that the quantum potential depends only on the form and not on the amplitude of the quantum field is evidently of crucial significance. As we have already suggested, although at first sight such behaviour seems to be totally outside of our common experience, a little reflection shows that this is not so. Effects of this kind are indeed frequently encountered in ordinary experience wherever we are dealing with information. Thus in the example of the ship guided by radio waves, one may say that these waves carry information about what is in the environment of the ship and that this information enters into the movements of the ship through its being taken up in the mechanism of the automatic pilot. Similarly we explain the interference properties by saying that the quantum field contains information, for example about the slits, and that this information is taken up in the movements of the particle. In effect, we have in this way introduced a concept that is new in the context of physics – a concept that we shall call active information. The basic idea of active information is that a form having very little energy enters into and directs a much greater energy. The activity of the latter is in this way given a form similar to that of the smaller energy.
>
>It is important to distinguish our concept of active information from the more technical definition of information commonly adopted in physics in terms of, for example, Shannon’s ideas implying that there is a quantitative measure of information that represents the way in which the state of a system is uncertain to us (e.g. that we can only specify probabilities of various states). It is true that such concepts have been used to calculate objective properties of systems in thermodynamics and even black holes etc., but we wish to propose here a quite different notion of information that is not essentially related to our own knowledge or lack of it. We emphasizes again that it is our thesis that this sort of usage of the word information is actually encountered in a wide range of areas of experience. What is crucial here is that we are calling attention to the literal meaning of the word, i.e. to in-form, which is actively to put form into something or to imbue something with form.
>
>As a simple example of what we mean, consider a radio wave whose form carries a signal. The sound energy we here in the radio does not come directly from the radio wave itself which is too weak to be detected by our senses. It comes from the power plug or batteries which provide an essentially unformed energy that can be given form (i.e., in-formed) by the pattern carried by the radio wave. This process is evidently entirely objective and has nothing to do with our knowing the details of how this happens. The information in the radio wave is potentially active everywhere, but it is actually active, only where and when it can give form to the electrical energy which, in this case, is in the radio.
>
>A more developed example of such a situation is given by considering the computer. The information content in a silicon chip can determine a whole range of potential activities which may be actualized by giving form to the electrical energy coming from a power source. Which of these possibilities will be actualized in a given case depends on a wider context and the responses of a computer operator.
>
>Although the above examples do indicate what we mean by the objective significance of active information, nevertheless they still depend on structures (like the radio set and the computer) which were originally designed and put together by human beings and so may be felt to retain a trace of subjectivity. An example that does not involve structures set up by human beings is the function of the DNA molecule. The DNA is said to constitute a code, that is to say, a language. The form of the DNA molecule is considered as information content for this code, while the ‘meaning’ is expressed in terms of various processes; e.g. those involving RNA molecules, which ‘read’ the DNA code, and carry out the protein-making activities that are implied by particular sections of the DNA molecule. The comparison to our notion of objective and active information is very close. Thus, in the process of cell growth it is only the form of the DNA molecule that counts, while the energy is supplied by the rest of the cell (and indeed ultimately by the environment as a whole). Moreover, at any moment, only a part of the DNA molecule is being ‘read’ and giving rise to activity. The rest is potentially active and may become actually active according to the total situation in which the cell finds itself.
>
>While we are bringing out above the objective aspects of information, we do not intend to deny its importance in subjective human experience. However, we wish to point out that even in this domain, the notion of active information still applies. A simple example is to be found in reading a map. In this activity we apprehend the information content of this map through our own mental energy. And by a whole set of virtual or potential activities in the imagination, we can see the possible significance of this map. Thus the information is immediately active in arousing the imagination, but this activity is still evidently inward within the brain and nervous system. If we are actually travelling in the territory itself then, at any moment, some particular aspect may be further actualized through our physical energies, acting in that territory (according to a broader context, including what the human being knows and what he is perceiving at that moment).
>
>We therefore emphasizes once again that even the information held by human beings is, in general, active rather than passive, not merely reflecting something outside itself but actually, or at least potentially, capable of participating in the thing to which it refers. Passive information may in fact be regarded as a limiting case in which we abstract from the activity of information. This is essentially the kind of information that is currently used in information theory, e.g. as used by Shannon. The puzzle in this approach is that of how information that is merely passive within us is able to determine actual objective processes outside of us. We suggest that passive information is rather like a map reflecting something of these processes which can guide us to organize them conveniently for our use, e.g. by means of algorithms that enable us to calculate entropy and other such properties.
>
>If the notion of active information applied both objectively and subjectively, it may well be that all information is at least potentially active and that complete passivity is never more than an abstraction valid in certain limited circumstances. In this context our proposals to use the concept of active information at the quantum level does not seem to be unnatural. […]
>
>The fact that the particle is moving under its own energy, but being guided by the information in the quantum field, suggest that an electron or any other elementary particle has a complex and subtle inner structure (e.g. perhaps even comparable to that of a radio). This notion goes against the whole tradition of modern physics which assumes that as we analyse matter into smaller and smaller parts its behaviour always grows more and more elementary. But our interpretation of the quantum theory indicates that nature is far more subtle and strange than previously thought. However, this sort of inner complexity is perhaps not as implausible as may appear at first sight. For example, a large crowd of people can be treated by simple statistical laws, whereas individually, their behaviour is immensely more subtle and complex. Similarly, large masses of matter reduce approximately to a simple Newtonian behaviour, whereas the molecules and atoms out of which matter is built have a more complex inner structure.
>
>To make this suggestion yet more plausible, we note that between the shortest distances now measurable in physics (of the order of 10e-16 cm) and the shortest distances in which current notions of space-time probably have meaning which is the order of 10e-33 cm, there is a vast range of scale in which an immense amount of yet undiscovered structure could be between our own size and that of the elementary particle. Moreover, since the vacuum is generally regarded as full with an immense energy of fluctuation, revealed for example in the Casimir effect, it may be further suggested that ultimately the energy of this particle comes from this source. (Some of it may also come from the rest energy of the particle.)
>
>It should be added here that (as happens with the radio wave) the quantum information field may also have some energy. However, as has been made clear in the many analogies given here, this must be negligible in comparison to the energy of the particle which it guides. […]
>
>A very important further implication of the notion of active information is that in a certain sense an entire experiment has to be regarded as a single undivided whole. This arises because the motion of the particles can be strongly affected by distant features of the environment such as the slits. On the other hand, in the corresponding classical experiment the slit system can be ignored once the particle has passes through it. And as has been pointed out, a different slit system would produce a different quantum potential which would affect the motion of the particles in a different way. Therefore the motion of the particles cannot properly be discussed in abstraction from the total experimental arrangement. This is reminiscent of Bohr’s notion of wholeness, but it differs in that the entire process is open to our ‘conceptual gaze’ and can therefore be analysed in thought, even if it cannot be divided in actuality without radically changing its nature.
>
>The idea of a ‘pilot wave’ that guides the movement of the electron was first suggested by de Broglie in 1927, but only in connection with the one body system. De Broglie presented this idea at the 1927 Solvay Congress where it was strongly criticized by Pauli. His most important criticism was that, in a two-body scattering process, the model could not be applied coherently. In consequence de Broglie abandoned his suggestion. The idea of a pilot wave was propose again in 1952 by Bohm in which an interpretation for the many-body system was given. This latter made it possible to answer Pauli’s criticism and indeed opened the way to a coherent interpretation including a theory of measurement which was applicable over a wide range of quantum phenomena. As a result de Broglie took up his original ideas again and continued to develop them in various ways.
>
>An important part of de Broglie’s early approach was to try to explain the assumptions underlying the pilot wave interpretation in terms of what he called the theory of the ‘double solution’. This was based on the assumption of a non-linear field equation which, in the linear approximation, approached the ordinary Schrödinger equation. However, for large amplitude, the non-linearity became important. He suggested that there would exist solutions which would correspond to a stable singularity or pulse when the amplitude was high and would gradually shade off into solutions of the linear Schrödinger equation at larger distances. The pulse would evidently correspond to a particle. […]
>
>However, a closer analysis shows that this is actually only a necessary condition and not a sufficient one. Indeed we can see that it cannot be sufficient by considering the fact that energy and momentum conservation are necessary consequences of the kinds of equations discussed by de Broglie. The momentum in the singularity will be very large in comparison with that available in the extremely weak pilot wave. Therefore it will not be possible to obtain solutions of the field equations which would lead to the very great accelerations that are in general implied by the guidance relation (e.g. as seen in our discussion of the two slit interference experiment). Rather, we have seen that to obtain a powerful effect from a very weak filed we need something like our concept of active information. For the phase clearly depends only on the form of the field and not on the amplitude. In our approach, it is this form which ‘in-forms’ the energy of the self­-movement of the particle. Therefore the key difference of our idea from that of de Broglie is that we do not attempt to explain the guidance relation in a simple mechanical way as an effect of non-linear propagation of fields. Instead we are appealing to the notion that a particle has a rich and complex inner structure which can respond to information and direct its self-motion accordingly.


### Chapter 4, the many-body system [p. 56]

>We shall now go on to consider the many-body system in which we shall see, in several striking ways, a further development of the difference between the classical and quantum ontologies, along with new concepts that are required for the latter. […]
>
>We have already seen that for the one-body system this means that the particle can depend strongly on distant features of the environment. In the two-body system we can have a similar dependence on the environment, but in addition, the two particles can also be strongly coupled at long distances. Their interaction can therefore be described as nonlocal. This is the first of the new concepts implied by the causal interpretation that comes out in the many-body case. […]
>
>For several centuries, there has been a strong feeling that nonlocal theories are not acceptable in physics. It is well known, for example, that Newton felt very uneasy about action-at-a-distance and that Einstein regarded it as ‘spooky’. One can understand this feeling, but if one reflects deeply and seriously on this subject one can see nothing basically irrational about such an idea. Rather it seems to be most reasonable to keep an open mind on the subject and therefore allow oneself to explore this possibility. If the price of avoiding nonlocality is to make an intuitive explanation impossible, one has to ask whether the cost is not too great.
>
>The only serious objection we can see to nonlocality is that, at first sight, it does not seem to be compatible with relativity, because nonlocal connections in general would allow a transmission of signals faster than the speed of light. In later chapters we extend the causal interpretation to a relativistic context and show that although nonlocality is still present, it does not introduce any inconsistencies into the theory, e.g. it does not imply that we can use the quantum potential to transmit a signal faster than light.
>
>While nonlocality as described above is an important new feature of the quantum theory, there is yet another new feature that implies an even more radical departure from the classical ontology, to which little attention has generally been paid thus far. This is that the quantum potential depends on the ‘quantum state’ of the whole system in a way that cannot be defined simply as a pre-assigned interaction between all the particles. […]
>
>The relationship between parts of a system described above implied a new quality of wholeness of the entire system going beyond anything that can be specified solely in terms of the actual spatial relationships of all the particles. This is indeed the feature which makes the quantum theory go beyond mechanism of any kind. For it is the essence of mechanism to say that basic reality consists of the parts of a system which are in a preassigned interaction. The concept of the whole, then, has only a secondary significance, in the sense that it is only a way of looking at certain overall aspects of what is in reality the behaviour of the parts. In our interpretation of the quantum theory, we see that the interaction of parts is determined by something that cannot be described solely in terms of these parts and their preassigned interrelationships. Rather it depends on the many-body wave function (which, in the usual interpretation, is said to determine the quantum state of the system). This many-body wave function evolves according to Schrödinger’s equation. Something with this kind of dynamical significance that refers directly to the whole system is thus playing a key role in the theory. We emphasise that this is the most fundamentally new aspect of the quantum theory.
>
>The above-described feature should, in principle, apply to the entire universe. At first sight this might suggest that we could never disentangle one part of the universe from the rest, so that there would be no way to do science as we know it or even to obtain knowledge by the traditional methods of finding systems that can be regarded as at least approximately isolated from their surroundings. However, it is actually possible to obtain such approximate separation in spite of the quantum wholeness that we have described above. […]
>
>In chapter 8, we will show that there is a widespread tendency for such factorized wave functions to arise in typical situations that prevail in the present stage of the development of the universe. Moreover we shall also show that in the classical limit where the quantum potential is negligible, nonlocal interactions will for this reason not be significant.
>
>We may say that while the basic law refers inseparably to the whole universe, this law is such as to imply that the universe tends to fall into a large number of relatively independent parts, each of which may, however, be constituted of further sub-units that are nonlocally connected. Therefore we can deal with these relatively independent parts in the traditional way as we do our experiments.
>
>We have seen that quantum theory implies a radically new behaviour of matter in several respects. It has been shown that all of this can be understood in terms of our notion of active information applied, not only to the one-body system, but also to the many-body system. Of course in a purely logical sense, the theory could be said to be defined without this notion and could, of course, be thus expressed in a logically consistent way. But it is a key part of our intention in this book to help make the theory more intelligible in an intuitive sense, and not merely regard it as a system of equations from which could be derived algorithms permitting a calculation of interesting results. We feel that at least something like the notion of active information would be needed in many attempts to do this; e.g. to account for quantum interference and the peculiar nonlocal properties of the many-body system in an intuitively understandable way. Here we emphasise again what we have said in chapter 3, that the notion of active information corresponds to a tremendous range of common experience. We have generally devalued this sort of experience as far as physics is concerned and have assumed that physical laws should contain only mechanical concepts such as position, momentum, force, etc. When it is found that these do not apply coherently in a quantum context, then as explained in chapter 2, it is effectively assumed that all we can do is to use the quantum formalism as an algorithm to calculate the probabilities of experimental outcomes. But what we are pointing out here is that if we suitably extend the kind of concepts that we are willing to admit into physics (e.g. to include active information) then we can obtain a much better intuitive apprehension of the theory. This, in turn, may help guide our thinking in physics into new directions.

### Chapter 5, transition processes considered as independent of observation [p. 73]

>In the usual interpretation it is an essential feature that transition processes can only be discussed in a context in which they are observed in a measurement process. In an ontological approach such as ours, it is, of course, necessary to discuss transition processes taking place on their own, independently of their being observed. In this chapter we shall show how this can be done.
>
>We shall begin with the simple example of barrier penetration and then go on to consider transitions of electrons in atoms from one level to another. In developing our ideas we shall also show that in our interpretation, the quantum theory implied two general tendencies that oppose each other:
>
>A tendency for wave functions to spread and become less well defined in space when the system is isolated.
A tendency for these functions to ‘narrow down’ the range in which they have an appreciable effect when interaction with a background takes place.
We shall call this latter tendency ‘self-definition’. It is essential to take this into account if we are to understand how the universe can be in a fairly well-defined state at any given moment in spite of the tendency to become less well defined because of the general ‘spreading’ of wave functions. On this basis we are able to discuss the states of things without any need to refer to a measuring apparatus which, in the usual interpretation, would cause the wave function to ‘collapse’ to a more definite state. […]
>
>All the basic concepts required to understand quantum transitions from a purely ontological point of view are already implicit in the simple example of barrier penetration given above. The essential point is that the wave packet has split into two distinct parts, which, in this case, will never meet again, as one goes to +∞ and the other to -∞. The particle must enter one of these packets, because there is no probability of being in between when the wave function is zero.
>
>We may conveniently describe this process by thinking that the two wave packets correspond to two distinct channels. Which channel the particle will actually enter is determined by its initial position in the incident wave packet. […]
>
>Since the channels do not overlap, the quantum potential in each can be calculated as if the other were not present. The same also holds for the guidance condition. Therefore in effect the system behaves as if it is in one of the channels only, with the appropriate probability that this is the case. We have, in this way, explained how a quantum transition takes place on its own, without the need to bring in a process of observation.
>
>But this raises an important question. Suppose, for example, that the particle is in the transmitted channel, corresponding to a wave function of very low intensity. Its physical properties are determined by this very weak quantum field, while the much stronger field corresponding to the reflected channel has no effect. Of course, as long as the channels do not overlap, we can understand this, because the quantum field does not act mechanically, but rather, as we have already discusses, it acts as information that guides the particle in its self-movement and in such action the intensity of the field does not matter.
>
>Nevertheless one may raise the question of what would happen if the channels were made to overlap again. For example, in two or three dimensions the experiment could be arranged to reflect both of the quantum fields into the same region of space. When this happened, the larger field would overwhelm the smaller one and the behaviour of the particle would be radically altered. In other words while the information in an ‘empty’ channel may not actually be active on the particle at a given moment, it may have the potentiality to become active later. Therefore one cannot say that the transmitted particle is in a state that is entirely independent of the reflected channel.
>
>This would, at first sight, seem to put in doubt our claim of having explained the transition process without the aid of an observation which would cause the wave function to ‘collapse’ irreversibly and finally, for example, to the transmitted state. In this connection, however, it must at first be pointed out, that the possibility of interference of the two channels that we have described is an inevitable consequence of the quantum theory whether in our interpretation or in the usual one. As long as we restrict ourselves to the abstraction of a one-body system, this implication neither can nor should be avoided.
>
>It is our thesis that only when we take into account the interaction of this system with a background containing many particles that the transition becomes, in effect, irrevocable. The reason for this is that the information in the unoccupied channel will lose all its potentiality for becoming active so that it will remain permanently inactive after interaction with a sufficiently complex background.
>
>The simplest case in which this happens arises when the particle in question collides with another one and scattering takes place through a short range interaction. […]
>
>Because there is such a process of the multiplication of non-overlapping channels corresponding to transmission of the particle, the possibility of bringing about overlap of transmitted and reflected channels in the way described earlier has effectively been eliminated. For in order to have such overlap, it is necessary that this overlap takes place in the configuration space of all systems which have interacted. Therefore if we merely have an arrangement that brings reflected and transmitted waves into the same region of space, there will still be no effect on the quantum potential. To have such an effect we would also have to bring together all the scattered channels. If this is not done, the information in the reflected channel remains inactive, even though it corresponds to a much more intense quantum field than does the transmitted channel.
>
>Of course one could consider trying to bring back into the same region of space all the channels that resulted from the various scattering processes. Evidently this would be immensely difficult, almost certainly beyond our present technical capacity. Nevertheless it is still a logical possibility. But we can see that this possibility is not relevant here because all the particles concerned will keep on encountering further systems with which they interact, and these will bring about a further multiplication of channels.
>
>Ultimately this process will lead to chaotic motions which are characteristics of thermodynamic equilibrium. As long as we accept the current explanations of the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes in terms of the notion of an approach to statistical equilibrium, for example through scattering, then we must also accept that the interactions that we have described here will similarly be irreversible. Therefore the channels to which we have alluded earlier will be irrevocably distinct. The quantum potential and the guidance condition will be determined only by the channel actually occupied by the system. The remaining channels will then correspond to what we have been calling inactive information, i.e. information not only actually inactive, but also having no potential for becoming active.
>
>All this implies that the channels corresponding to actually or potentially active information are constantly narrowing down as the system in question interacts with its surroundings. But it is implied by Schrödinger’s equation that the wave function of a system is constantly spreading. These two processes evidently oppose each other as we have already indicated earlier, and the net result comes out of the balance between the tendency to spread and the tendency to narrow down to a more definite form.
>
>The narrowing down process produces a net effect that is essentially the same as that produced by the ‘collapse’ of the wave function in the usual interpretation. Yet there is no collapse here. At no stage do we need to violate our basic postulates in order to obtain the self-definition of the system. We shall discuss the full implications of this in more detail later, but for the present we shall emphasise only that this means that measurement does not have to play a fundamental role in our interpretation. Rather the universe is constantly defining itself and measurement is only a special case of this. […]
>
>It must be emphasised that our equations for the particle motions differ from the non-linear equations that have commonly been considered thus far, in that the forces, as determined by the quantum potential, are not preassigned functions either of external variables or of the particle coordinates. Rather, as was brought out in chapter 4, they depend on a quantum field of active information ordered in the configuration space which involves the whole system in a way that cannot be analyses solely in terms of relationships between the particles. It is this feature which makes it possible for such dramatically different limit cycles to emerge as a result of the evolution of the wave function even for simple systems. The fact that the activity of the quantum field does not necessarily fall off with the intensity of the wave is also crucial for this behaviour, since without it we could not have had some transitions taking place almost immediately even when the perturbed wave function was very weak. It is clear then that the new features of the quantum potential described above are principally what are behind the ability of our extension of Newton’s equations of motion to comprehend the new quantum properties of matter. This brings out in further detail the point that we made in chapter 3, i.e. that classical physics does not follow from the form of Newton’s equations alone, but also requires certain restrictions on the forces that appear in these equations. When, as is the case of the quantum potential, we go beyond such restrictions, an entirely new kind of physical law is implied.
>
>We now go on to extend the results of the previous section to the case of capture of an electron by an atom. This, combined with the discussion of ionization that we have just given, will enable us to bring out how quantum mechanics implies the possibility of the formation of objective wholes as well as their dissolution into relatively independent parts and sub-wholes. As we saw in chapter 4, this is one of the principal new properties of matter implied by quantum theory. […]
>
>To come back to our description in terms of active information, we would also say that the original atom was characterized by a certain common pool of such information which broke up and reformed into a new pool that included the x-particle instead of the y-particle. We emphasise once again that this process of forming and dissolving wholes is essentially quantum mechanical. For it is only through the existence of such pools of information which are not expressible solely in terms of relationships of the actual particles that the notion of an objective whole can be given meaning. In contrast, as we have said earlier in classical physics there is no such objective significance to the whole, the latter can at best be regarded as a convenient way of thinking about what is considered to be in reality a set of parts. Quantum mechanics thus implied a new kind of process; i.e. the collection and dissolution of wholes. The language of ordinary quantum mechanics already tends to suggest this, in so far as it treats the quantum state as an unanalyzable whole. However, as we have already suggested in earlier chapters, in out interpretation this wholeness becomes more intuitively intelligible because this interpretation highlights the new features of the quantum theory that bring it about.
>
>The essential point of this chapter was to demonstrate with the aid of a number of typical examples that the transition process can be treated ontologically, i.e. as having no essential relationship to measurement or observation. We showed that in such a transition the wave function effectively splits so as to define a number of separate channels. The quantum potential was determined only by the channel that the particle actually enters. The channel entered by the particle depends on the initial conditions which are distributed statistically in an ensemble. From this it follows that the probability of obtaining a certain result is the same as in the usual interpretation.
>
>In effect, everything happens as if the wave function ‘collapses’ to the final result, while no collapse actually takes place. The channels not occupied by the particles correspond to inactive information. We showed that if the particles make collisions with additional systems, there is a constant narrowing down of the domain in which the wave function can significantly affect the quantum potential at the location of the particles. From this is follows that the channel entered by the particles eventually becomes irreversibly fixed, so that is cannot be undone.
>
>An analysis of the behaviour of the particle orbits shows that there are bifurcation points dividing those orbits entering one channel from those entering another. Near these points, the motion is highly unstable and, indeed, chaotic in the sense of modern chaos theory. Stationary states then correspond to an extension of the concept of stable limit cycles which is found in the theory of non-linear differential equations.
>
>Finally we discuss the process of formation and dissolution of wholes (fission-fusion). This brings out the possibility of an objective ontological wholeness and of a distinction between states of such wholeness and states in which the parts or sub-wholes behave independently. We understand this through the formation of common pools of information. This information bring about nonlocal interaction, but quantum wholeness implies even more than this. For it arises out of the quantum field which cannot be understood solely in terms of preassigned properties and interrelationships of the particles alone. Rather the whole is presupposed in the quantum wave function and it is the active information in this wave function that forms and dissolves wholes.

### Chapter 6, measurement as a special case of quantum process [p. 97]

>As pointed out in chapter 2, in the conventional interpretation of the quantum theory (which is basically epistemological in nature) measurement plays a key role in the sense that without it the mathematical equations would have no physical meaning. In our ontological interpretation, however, we have started with a treatment of the individual, actual process, e.g. a particle penetrating a barrier, undergoing transition between stationary states etc. Evidently it is necessary to deal with the measurement process in essentially the same way; i.e. as a special case of quantum processes in general. What is particularly significant in a measurement process is that from a large scale result that is observable in a piece of measuring apparatus, one can infer the state of the observed system, or at least the state in which it has been left after the measurement process is over.
>
>In this chapter we shall treat the measurement process in some detail and show how it to be understood ontologically. We shall first discuss the general principles of this process. We shall show that the essential new feature of quantum measurement is that there is mutual and irreducible participation of the measuring instrument and the observed object in each other. As a result, any attempt to discuss this process as measuring ‘a property of the observed object alone’ will not be consistent with our interpretation. Rather we say that the result of measurement is a potentiality of the system and can be determined only in terms of the properties of the particles, along with the wave function of the combined system as a whole. […]
>
>At this stage we can say that everything has happened as if the overall wave function had ‘collapsed’ to one corresponding to the actual result obtained in the measurement. We emphasize, however, that in our treatment there is no actual collapse; there is merely a process in which the information represented by the unoccupied packets effectively loses all potential for activity. Or as we have put it in chapter 5, the range of potential activity of this information is spontaneously narrowed down in essentially the same way as happened with transition processes. It follows that in this regard measurement is indeed just a special case of a transition process in which the two systems interact and then come out in correlated states. It is this correlation that enables us, from the observed result, to attribute a corresponding property to the final state of the observed system.
>
>In the transition process that takes place in a measurement, it is clear that (as happens indeed in all transition processes) there is no need to place any ‘cuts’ or arbitrary breaks in the description of reality, such as that, for example, introduced by von Neumann between the quantum and classical levels (see chapter 2). In fact we have given what is, in principle, a detailed account of the whole process of measurement which is not restricted to the phenomena alone as Bohr requires (while nevertheless retaining a wholeness similar to that of Bohr in certain ways which will be discussed in more detail later).
>
>For those who are accustomed to the conventional interpretation of the quantum theory, the notion of empty wave packets arising naturally in transition processes and artificially in measurement processes may not seem to be acceptable, even though we have shown that they constitute inactive information that will never have any subsequent effect on the particles.
>
>This objection probably arises mainly because the conventional interpretation assumes either tacitly or explicitly that the wave function corresponds to the actual state of the system and as such constitutes the basic description of reality, at least in so far as this latter can be described in any way at all. Therefore it could be felt that the empty packets, which also satisfy Schrödinger’s equation, constitute a vast mass of ‘bits of reality’ that are, as it were, ‘floating around’ interpenetrating that part of reality which corresponds to the occupied packets.
>
>In our interpretation, however, we do not assume that the basic reality is thus described primarily by the wave function. Rather, as we have stated in chapter 3, we begin with the assumption that there are particles following definite trajectories (and as we shall see in chapter 11 we can also incorporate ordinary fields such as the electromagnetic in this general approach). We then assume that the wave function describes a qualitatively new kind of quantum field which determines the guidance conditions and the quantum potential acting on the particle. We are not denying the reality of this field, but we are saying that its significance is relatively subtle in the sense that it contains active information that ‘guides’ the particle in its self-movement under its own energy. The behaviour of the particles is profoundly affected by this field so that it has fundamentally new features relative to those of classical physics. The effects of the quantum field will, however, become manifest only at the classical level in the collective movement of large numbers of particles. In the latter, the WKB approximation will generally hold and the quantum fields can be neglected. So ultimately all manifestations of the quantum fields are through the particles.
>
>We may make an analogy here to human relationships in society. The most immediate and concrete reality is the collection of individual human beings. In so far as these are related by pools of information, this latter will become manifest in the behaviour of the human beings. The behaviour both of the individual and of the society depend crucially on this information (rather as happens with the particles of physics). The information itself held at some very subtle level which does not show directly and which has negligible energy compared with that involved in the physical movements of the people. To complete the analogy we might surmise that perhaps the information in the wave function is likewise contained at a more subtle level of negligible energy in a way that has not shown yet and that we have not thus far been able to study.
>
>In this analogy we can see that information is constantly losing its potential for activity. For example, people may see that some of it is irrelevant or wrong, while a great deal may simply be forgotten. Even if the information is preserved in books or on discs, most of these latter eventually become more and more difficult to access, for example, by being sent to depositories and ultimately by being shredded. Other information is simply lost by dispersal, for example, by the spread of sound waves and radio waves. In so far as this information can no longer affect human beings (or their proxies in the form of computers) it has lost its potential for activity.
>
>It is clear then that nothing is more common in ordinary experience than for information to lose its potential for activity. If we accept that the particle is what responds to information at the quantum mechanical level, it is clear that there is no serious problem with the empty wave packets. The essential point is that information is immensely more subtle and less substantial than the systems on which it acts. If we give up the idea that the wave function is what comes closest to describing that which may be called the substance of reality, then the loss of potential for activity will be quite a natural and, indeed, even an expected feature.
>
>Another reason why many may have found it difficult to accept our ontological interpretation is that the wave function is all that is used in statistical calculations, which indeed makes no mention of the particles, except to say that the statistics yield the frequency with which they may be registered in specified experiments. Since particles seem to play no part in the calculations, and since the latter are what occupy the major part of the attention of physicists, it may be felt that the wave function (which corresponds to the quantum state) is in essence what the theory is all about. Therefore to have inactive parts of the wave function may seem unacceptable.
>
>However, if we think further about our analogy to the behaviour of human beings we may note, for example, that in the statistical behaviour of people moving on roads with signs that inform them, their behaviour could in certain cases be calculated from the information implied by the signs without the need for a detailed description of the movement and activity of the human being as a whole, e.g. including his muscles, his senses, his brain and nervous system etc. Similarly it need not be surprising to discover that the statistical behaviour of the particles of physics can be calculated from the information in the wave function without knowledge of the detailed constitution of the particles themselves.
>
>In both cases the fact that a quantity provides a complete basis for statistical calculations does not imply that is also provides a complete basis for an ontology. […]
>
>Since our interpretation gives the same statistical distribution of experimental results as does the conventional one, it follows that the proofs usually given for the uncertainty principle will also be valid in our approach. The meaning of the uncertainty principle is, of course, that there is a limit to the precision with which properties can be attributed to the observed object on the basis of observed experimental results. Or as Bohr has put it, there is an irreducible ambiguity in the meaning of these results as referring to intrinsic properties of the observed object.
>
>Because of this ambiguity, it becomes impossible to know from a measurement exactly what the state of the particle is and, of course, this implies that we do not know exactly how it is going to behave after the measurement. In general, the ambiguities of the actual particles’ position and momenta will be of the order of those present in the spread of the wave packets (as we have explained in more detail in chapter 3). But in particular cases this may not be so. For example, in a stationary state, the ambiguity in the momentum of the particle was seen to be zero. So if this momentum represents the actual momentum of a particle as it moves (or is at rest) in its trajectory, Heisenberg’s principle can in certain cases be violated. In our interpretation, however, what Heisenberg’s principle refers to is not the actual momentum of the particle itself, but the value of the momentum that can be attributed to the particle after what is commonly called a measurement of the momentum. And because measurements are actually participatory, these two can differ. Indeed it is misleading and even confusing to describe what happens as a measurement (rather as if in the observation of the mature plant, we were said to be ‘measuring’ the properties of the seed). Perhaps as Bell has suggested, we should call the whole process an experiment or even a participatory experiment revealing the potentialities of the system in question. (Indeed this participatory feature has already been noted by Wheeler in a different context in which, however, there is no way to explain how it comes about.) […]
>
>What we learn from the measurement is not only the value of the operator but also the final effective wave function of the observed system. From this we can locate the observed particle somewhere in the region in which the wave function of the particle is appreciable. The role of the particle is crucial here and it makes it possible for the system to select one of the eigenfunctions which will be effective without the need for a collapse.
>
>If in the quantum domain experiments are thus mutually participatory transformations how do we understand the ordinary classical experience in which we definitely obtain measured results that can be unambiguously attributed to the observed system without any question of mutual participation? The answer is, of course, that for measurements carried out in the classical limit such participation is negligible, and the transformation of the wave function is unimportant because the quantum potential is negligible. […]
>
>Most of the further paradoxes of the conventional interpretations of the quantum theory arise from the above described assumption, made especially sharply by von Neumann, that the wave function provides the most complete description of reality that is possible. For when the wave function is constituted of a linear combination of components, the actual state of the system is ambiguous in the sense that there is no way to define it as being in one of the components or the other. The process by which the system ‘collapses’ is then mysterious and often ultimately paradoxical.
>
>In a long article devoted to this whole subject, Schrödinger criticized such assumptions with the aid of his now famous cat paradox. To formulate this paradox we being by assuming a cat isolated in a box with a gun pointed at the cat. The firing mechanism for the gun is activated when an individual electron strikes it. We further suppose a source of the individual electrons which pass through a beam splitter. The effect of this splitter is to divide the wave function into two coherent parts. The first part simply goes off harmlessly and is absorbed. The second part is aimed at the device that fires the gun. Classically one would expect from this arrangement that is a single electron enters the system, there would be equal probability after the experiment was over for the cat to be alive or dead. This statement could be made meaningfully even before anyone had looked in the box to see what had happened.
>
>Quantum mechanically, however, we must treat this situation in terms of the wave function. […]
>
>Since the two components of this wave function are coherent, it then follows in terms of the von Neumann interpretation, that the state of the total system cannot be one or the other. It therefore seems that the cat is in a state that is neither alive nor dead. This ambiguity could be removed only when someone looked into the box and saw whether the cat was dead or alive. The question immediately arises then of whether in the case that the cat was found to be dead, the observer had not actually participated in ‘killing the cat’.
>
>Schrödinger regarded this whole situation as absurd. Firstly it did not make sense to him that observation was needed to answer the question of whether the cat was alive or dead, In addition, even before observation, one might well think that the cat should at least know more than this about its own state. Or if one does not wish to attribute consciousness to the cat, suppose instead that it had been a human being in the box. To avoid violence we could replace the gun by a device that would prick his skin. Would this person find himself in an ambiguous state in which his skin was neither clearly untouched nor clearly pricked by the device?
>
>In our approach this sort of paradox does not arise because we go beyond the assumption that the wave function provides the most complete description of reality. To define the actual state of being of the cat, we have to consider in addition the particles that constitute it. It is evident that when the cat is alive, many of these particles will be in quite different places and will move quite differently than they would if the cat were dead. Indeed one can easily see that in the configuration space of the particles of the cat, there will be no overlap or both state functions of the cat. Therefore it is clear that at the end of the experiment the cat has to be either alive or dead. For the wave function corresponding to the live cat has no effect on the quantum potential acting on the dead cat or vice versa.
>
>Indeed this sort of nonoverlap is present in the conventional interpretations. However, in these latter, there is no way to remove the ambiguity in the state of being in a coherent wave function even when the components do not overlap. But in our interpretation the state of being also depends on the positions of the particles that constitute it and it is this which enables us to treat this situation non-parodoxically as in essence a simple case of pairs of alternative and mutually exclusive states.
>
>As a matter of fact it is not even necessary to go as far the cat to resolve this paradox. Thus if we consider the system of firing device, plus gun, bullet and powder, it is clear that there is no overlap between the wave function of the ‘unfired state’ and the one of the ‘fired state’ (i.e. because after firing, the powder will become gas and the bullet will move so that their particles will be in very different positions). Therefore the particle constituting this system will either be in the state corresponding to the firing or non-firing of the gun. If the gun has actually fired, the bullet will be speeding towards the cat (and will not be in an ambiguous state in which it is neither moving towards the cat nor at rest). The state of the dead cat will then follow only if the bullet is actually moving towards it. In other words, once the electron has in effect been ‘detected’, everything proceeds in essentially the same way as it does in classical physics.
>
>Wheeler has given a detailed description of several possible types of ‘delayed choice’ experiments. These are designed to show that, according to the quantum theory, the choice to measure one or another of a pair of complementary variables at a given time can apparently affect the state of things for considerable periods of time before such a decision is made.
>
>Like Bohr, Wheeler puts a primary emphasis on the phenomenon, in which the experimental arrangement and the experimental result constitute an indivisible whole in the way discussed in chapter 2, section 2.1. From his analysis of the delayed choice type of experiment, he concludes that “no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon”, so that “the universe does not ‘exist out there’ independently of all acts of observation. It is in some strange sense a participatory universe. The present choice of the mode of observation… should influence what we say about the past... The past is undefined and undefinable without the observation”.
>
>We can with Wheeler that no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is observed, because, by definition, a phenomenon is what appears. Therefore it evidently cannot be a phenomenon unless it is the content an observation. The key point about an ontological interpretation such as ours to ask the question as to whether there is an underlying reality that exists independently of observation, but that can appear to an observer when he ‘looks’ (in physics, with the aid of suitable instruments). We have proposed a model of such a reality in which we say, along with Wheeler, that the universe is essentially participatory in nature. However, unlike Wheeler, we have given an account of this participation, which we show throughout this book to be rational and orderly and in agreement with all the actual predictions of quantum theory. In doing this we assume, as we have been emphasizing throughout this chapter, that the underlying reality is not just the wave function, but that it also has to include the particles. As we shall see in this section, when we take this into account there is no need to say that the past is affected by our observation in the present. Nor do we imply even that what we say about the past is thus affected. Therefore the need to introduce such ideas is based on the insistence that the wave function provides a complete description of reality. Such insistence has led, as we have seen, to many other strange paradoxical features, e.g. with negative measurements and with the Schrödinger cat paradox. It seems to us preferable to consider extending our notion of reality by including the concept of particles, rather than to go on with an indefinite series of paradoxical consequences of sticking rigidly to the assumptions underlying the conventional interpretation of the quantum theory.

### Chapter 7, nonlocality [p. 134]

>We have seen earlier that nonlocality is a basically new feature of the quantum theory, at least in our interpretation. In this chapter we shall go into this topic in more detail, especially with regard to the analysis of the experiment of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR).
>
>We shall first review briefly how this question is to be treated in terms of the various interpretations, and we shall show that all but one of them imply some form of nonlocality. However, it has generally been felt that the very concept of nonlocality is unacceptable in a scientific theory and so people have sought an explanation of this behaviour in terms of local hidden variables that would in principle determine the results of each measurement. This leads us then to give a brief discussion of Bell’s inequality (which has to be satisfied by ay such explanation), and also of the fact that Bell’s inequality is not actually satisfied, either by the predictions of the quantum theory or by the experiments that have been done to test this point.
>
>We then go on to discuss how our own interpretation deals consistently with these questions by bringing in a nonlocal connection through the quantum potential. We finally explain the fact that nonlocality is not commonly encountered at the large scale level by showing that it is generally difficult to maintain the wave functions that are needed for this except for certain systems at low temperatures (such as superconductors) and highly isolated systems that have to be produced in a rather artificial way.
>
>Nonlocality is usually discussed in terms of the EPR experiment. However, EPR emphasised not only the question of nonlocality, but also that of whether the quantum mechanics was what they called complete. By this they did not mean that is should cover everything that could ever be known, but rather that it had all the concepts necessary for its coherence as the basis of an ontology. The result of their analysis was that it was not complete in this sense. We shall give here a brief résumé of their analysis as it would apply to a spin experiment involving a molecule of total spin zero, each of whose atoms have a spin of one-half.
>
>Their discussion was based essentially on what they meant by an element of reality. In general terms this signified some feature of the world that is real, independently of its being observed or otherwise known by us. In particular they proposed a sufficient criterion for such an element of reality: if, without disturbing the system in any way, one can predict the values of a given quantity with certainty, i.e. with probability equal to unity, then that quantity corresponds to an element of reality. Clearly this fits in with our general intuitive notions of what is to be meant by an independently existent element of reality. […]
>
>If such an interaction was operating, then the criterion of EPR for an element of reality would clearly be irrelevant, since by hypothesis a disturbance of atom A can now bring about a disturbance of atom B. However, EPR did not seem to regard this sort of interaction as worthy of serious consideration. To see why, we note that there are two possibilities:
>
>- The force is transmitted at some finite speed less than or equal to that of light. In this case the statistical predictions of the current quantum theory would, of course, have to fail for measurements of A and B that are space-like separated. But EPR assumed, as we have pointed out, that these statistical predictions are correct, and thus they did not even envisage such a failure of the current quantum theory.
>- The interaction is transmitted instantaneously. In this case the interaction would have to be nonlocal, i.e. to operate directly and immediately between the two particles with a strong force even at very large distances. Evidently this would violate the special theory of relativity.
>
>However, Einstein felt there was an even more fundamental objection, because independently of relativistic considerations, the thought that all action had to be local, while he regarded nonlocal interactions as ‘spooky’ and thus in some way unacceptable. Nevertheless he did believe that a suitable local explanation of this sort of experiment could eventually be obtained, perhaps on the basis of a new theory containing additional concepts that would represent new elements of reality. It is clear then that EPR did not make an explicit discussion of the question of nonlocality and focused instead on that of completeness.
>
>Bohr, appreciating the penetrating criticism of EPR, took great care in formulating a response. Essentially this consisted in pointing out that his own approach of complementarity still applied, even when the particles were separated by large distances and when the results of experiments are separated by large intervals of time. The main point was that the attempt to analyse the process in detail, and in doing so to attribute independent reality to the properties of the particle B, for example, was not permissible in the quantum mechanical context. This is because the form of the experimental conditions and the content (meaning) of the experimental results are, in Bohr’s view, a whole that is not further analyzable. […]
>
>The crucial point here is that Bohr is using a different notion of reality from that of EPR. For Bohr a concept represents reality only in so far as it is in unambiguous correspondence with the whole set of possible phenomena and these phenomena are necessarily such that they have to be described in terms of the concepts of classical physics. For Einstein, however, concepts are a ‘free creation of the human mind’ and their correspondence with reality is at first assumed and then tested by the phenomena they predict. Therefore there is no problem in assuming the simultaneous reality of all the properties of particle B even though these cannot be simultaneously observed. Bohr regards this as a totally inadmissible way of using concepts in the context of quantum theory in which these have to be ambiguous and mutually exclusive, but nevertheless complementary.
>
>The above constitutes the essence of Bohr’s answer to the emphasis of EPR on the question of completeness of the quantum theory. However, from this it also follows that it has no meaning, in his view, to talk about nonlocality. Indeed, according to Bohr nothing can be said about the detailed behaviour of individual systems at the quantum level of accuracy. There is only the total unanalyzable experimental phenomenon and no way to discuss in detail what this could mean ontologically. Therefore it also follows that there is no meaning to talking about locality either. All that we can do is to use the quantum algorithm to calculate the probabilities of the various experimental results. Nevertheless it still seems that some kind of nonlocality is, at least, implicit in Bohr’s approach, because the phenomenon itself, which is spread out over space and time, is considered to be an unanalyzable whole. […]
>
>Bell’s inequality has been tested in a large number of experiments and generally speaking the inequality has been found to be violated. These experiments do not use particles with spin but instead use correlations of polarized photons produced in atomic cascades. It can be easily shown that this case is mathematically equivalent to that of spin. The first experiment of this kind was performed by Freedman and Clauser. The latest and perhaps the most thorough set of experiments, has been performed by Aspect et al. In particular the latter were able to test whether the correlations were maintained even when the events of detection of the two photons were outside each other’s light cones. Aspect et al. found the inequality was still violated. This implied that, independently of quantum mechanics, we have an experimental proof that if there are hidden variables they must be nonlocal.
>
>Aspect’s experiment have been criticized by some physicists. The main criticism is that Bell’s inequalities could have been absolutely proved to have been violated only if the photon detector had an efficiency close to unity. With the actual rather low efficiencies of these detectors, there seems to be room for assumptions concerning the hidden variables of the apparatus which could still preserve locality in spite of the experimental results. However, these assumptions seem rather arbitrary and acritical and, in fact, they give the impression of being contrived just to ‘save the appearances’. The least we can say is that there is a strong prima facie case for nonlocality. […]
>
>We have thus far gone extensively into quantum nonlocality and have seen that it can arise in a great many contexts. At first sight one might be concerned as to whether we will then be able to understand why nonlocality is not encountered in our common experience of the world. Basically the answer to this question is quite simple. For our ordinary experience, both in the domain of common sense and in that of classical physics, is restricted to situations in which the quantum potential is very small, so that, in this context at least, it does not produce significant EPR correlations. For, as we have seen, quantum nonlocality is entirely the product of the quantum potential. […]
>
>We have seen that some kind of nonlocality is common to all interpretations of the quantum theory which we have discussed thus far. Nevertheless there have been persistent and strong objections to the consideration of nonlocal theories of any kind, usually with the hope that a local interpretation will sooner or later be possible.
>
>In ancient times it does not seem that strong objections to nonlocality were very common. However, by the sixteenth century nonlocality did not seem to be an acceptable concept. For example, Newton referred to it as a ‘philosophical absurdity’. This sort of view continued to modern times. Thus, as we have already pointed out earlier, when Einstein noticed the possible nonlocal implications of the quantum theory, he referred to it as ‘spooky’ action at a distance. The general mode of explanation that is currently acceptable in science is either action through contact or else action propagated continuously by fields. Indeed anything more than this is often regarded as incompatible with the very possibility of doing science.
>
>We cannot see any well-founded reason for such objections to the concept of nonlocality. Rather they seem to be more or less of the nature of a prejudice which developed together with the growth of modern science. First of all, the concept of nonlocality is perfectly rational in the way that we have used it in our interpretation of the quantum theory. For it has led neither to internal logical contradiction nor to disagreement with any facts. Moreover there is nothing in what we have done that disagrees fundamentally with the current scientific approach. Some people might object that if everything is strongly and nonlocally connected, there is no way to do science, because we will not be able to isolate any system sufficiently to study it. But we have shown that in the context of the large scale level in which physical investigations are carried out, nonlocal effects are not significant. Therefore our interpretation allows for exactly the same degree of separability of systems that is required for the kind of scientific work that is actually being done. We then made nonlocal inferences about the finer and more subtle aspects of material processes, but these are based on ordinary rational scientific inferences. Indeed it is just by using the well-established methods of science that we have been led to make such inferences of nonlocality.
>
>Another objection to nonlocality is that it would violate special relativity. We shall discuss this question in more detail in chapter 12, where we shall show that our interpretation is, in fact, compatible with special relativity. For the present we merely note that, as has been shown in section 7.2, quantum nonlocality will not allow a signal to be transmitted faster than light by means of the statistical measurements that are basic to the current quantum theory in its conventional interpretation. Since our interpretation leads to the same results as do the conventional ones, it follows that through quantum nonlocality there will be no way to exert instant control over what happens at far away places, nor to transmit signals to such places.
>
>We have not yet found what we could regard as a valid logical or scientific reason for dismissing nonlocality. We are therefore led to ask whether there could not be some other kind of reason. It may well be that one of the main reasons that people dislike the concept of nonlocality can be found in the history of science. For in the early period of the development of science there was a long struggle to get free from what may perhaps have been regarded as primitive superstitions and magical notions in which nonlocality clearly played a key part. Perhaps there has remained a deep fear that the mere consideration of nonlocality might reopen the flood gates for what are felt to be irrational thoughts that lurk barely beneath the surface of modern culture. But as we have argued, there is no inherent reason why this should happen. However, even if there were such a danger, this would not by itself constitute a valid argument against nonlocality. Indeed if one were to accept such arguments one might equally well say, for example, that nuclear energy should not even be considered for further investigation because it might lead not only to nuclear war, but also to radioactive contamination and to destructive genetic mutations. While it is necessary to be aware of all these dangers, we still have to be able to enquire freely into all these avenues of research.

### Chapter 8, the large scale world and the classical limit of the quantum theory [p. 160]

>We have been discussing what may be called quantum reality as existing on its own without needing any observers, but capable nevertheless of containing observing instruments. We have suggested in several places that there is a continuous transition between this total quantum reality and the large scale world of ordinary experience. The question before us now is whether we can explain how this large scale world as a whole comes out of the basic quantum laws, or at any rate, those features of this large scale world that can be described in terms of classical physics. In other words, is classical physics contained in our interpretation of the quantum theory as a limiting case?
>
>In order to answer this question it is essential to show that quantum mechanics contains a classical level which is not presupposed as in the usual approach, but which follows as a possibility within the quantum theory itself. Here we must point out that this is by no means self-evident. It is of course clear that we will obtain classical behaviour whenever the quantum potential is negligible. But as we shall see, quantum theory generally implied the possibility that even for very high quantum numbers, the quantum potential may still be large. The behaviour at the large scale level is therefore in general not necessarily classical. However, we shall show that the general conditions in the universe are actually such as to imply an approximately classical behaviour for objects containing a sufficiently large number of particles (which means that there is a classical level that is essentially independent of measuring instruments). This is a distinct advantage of the ontological interpretation, for as we shall bring out later, all other interpretations presuppose a classical level (chapter 13) or else imply the assumption of some kind of change in the basic theory, which makes possible the classical level (Stapp, Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber [GRW] and Gell-Mann and Hartle).
>
>The classical level is necessary not only because it is observed to exist, but also because within it, quantum mechanical processes can manifest themselves in phenomena which are essentially independent of further observation. As we shall see, it is this which makes it possible for people to establish and share knowledge of an objective nature in spite of the nonlocality of the fundamental laws. […]
>
>We are now in a position to give at least the general outlines of an overall world view that is implied by our interpretation of the quantum theory.
>
>Our first experience is, of course, of a world that is revealed to us fairly directly by our senses in relation to our outward actions and inward reflections in thought. The immediate experience in this world is that which is described by what is called common sense, but later, as Bohr has pointed out, this is refined, where necessary, to the more exact description of classical physics. Within the domain of such experience it may be said that this world is manifest. According to its Latin root, the word manifest would signify what can be held in the hand. More generally it is what can be held in the hand, the eye, and, of course, scientific instruments. Its basic characteristic is that it contains certain relatively stable structures that make the holding possible. These structures must not only be relatively stable, but also essentially local. Everything in this world can be ultimately constituted of such structures which are outside of each other in every sense and which interact only locally.
>
>Without such a world we would not be able to make sense of our observations of matter, nor to assign causes in any orderly way. Indeed it is for this reason that there is a natural reluctance to consider ideas such as nonlocality and indivisible wholeness, i.e. non-separability, into independently existent component parts.
>
>When we come to the underlying quantum world, we find that it has a radically different nature. To be sure we still assume a particle, which at first sight would appear to be what is also done in classical physics. But we now say further that this particle is profoundly affected by the wave function, i.e. through the quantum potential and the guidance condition. The action of the quantum potential depends only its form and not on its magnitude, so that its effect may be dominant even when the wave intensity is small. This implied the possibility of a strong nonlocal connection of distant particles and a strong dependence of the particle on its general environmental context. The forces between particles depend on the wave function of the whole system, so that we have what we may call ‘indivisible wholeness’. This means that for different wave functions we can have radically different connections between particles (not expressible, for example, in terms of a predetermined interaction potential). Thus there is a kind of objective wholeness, reminiscent of the organic wholeness of a living being in which the very nature of each part depends on the whole.
>
>All this behaviour is very different from what is to be expected classically. Indeed as we have already explained in chapter 3, classical physics depends not only on Newton’s laws of motion for the particles, but also on the nature of the potentials acting on them. The quantum potential implied so fundamental a difference in the behaviour of particles that we cannot regard the latter in general as remotely classical under most circumstances.
>
>Because of nonlocality, quantum jiggling under quantum interference conditions and other quantum properties to which we have alluded, we may say that the quantum world is subtle. According to the dictionary this means “rarified, highly refined, delicate, elusive, indefinable”. Its root meaning is based on the Latin subtexlis which signifies “finely woven”. Clearly the quantum world as we have described it cannot be held in the hand or in any other way. The very effort to hold it, e.g. in measurement, produces thoroughgoing unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in it. Each element participates irreducibly in all the others. The absence of mutual externality and reparability of all the elements makes this world very elusive to grasp of our instruments. It slips through the ordinary ‘nets’ that we have devised to hold it. Nevertheless we are proposing that it is real and indeed that is constitutes a more basic reality than does the classical ‘world’. Indeed as we have shown, this classical ‘world’ comes out of the theory as relatively autonomous. This autonomy arises wherever the quantum potential can be neglected so that the classical world can be treated on its own as if it were independently existent. But according to our interpretation it is actually an abstraction from the subtle quantum world which is being taken as the ultimate ground of existence.
>
>In the quantum ‘world’ there is no way to obtain an objective public display of results because everything in it is so irregularly mobile, subtle and mutually interdependent. But in the classical sub-world, events can happen that are negligibly affected by our measurements and observations. This sub-world includes not only particles, but also fields. We have not yet discussed the fields (though, as we have already pointed out, this will be done in some detail in chapter 11). Nevertheless we can say that the movement of classical describable distribution of charge will produce classically describable movements of fields.
>
>This world of fields and particles is what conveys information to our senses in a well-defined way. Indeed we know of no other conditions in which this could happen. For example it is well known that the eye can be sensitive to a few quanta at a time, but the reception of a small number of quanta gives only the vaguest sense of optical stimulation. Meaningful perception requires a large number of quanta and therefore, along the lines we have already explained this will imply an essentially classical behaviour. Meaningful communication between people also requires classically describable processes involving a large number of quanta. Thus it is not that we are assuming that the brain responds only to the states of particles and not their wave functions. Rather we are simply calling attention to the observed fact that meaningful sense perception and communication has to go through the classical level in which the effects of this wave function can be consistently left out of account.
>
>But, of course, this does not mean that we cannot learn about the quantum world. Instead, as we have shown, for example, through a process of amplification and recording in the stable structure of a measuring apparatus, the overall quantum ‘world’ can manifest itself in the more limited classical ‘sub-world’.
>
>In demonstrating this possibility we have not had to assume any kind of ‘cut’ between these two ‘worlds’ such as that supposed by von Neumann. Rather there is only one overall quantum world which contains an approximately classical ‘sub-world’ that gradually emerges under conditions that have been described throughout this chapter. As we have said earlier we do not believe that this kind of result has been achieved by other interpretations without making assumptions that go beyond the scope of the current quantum theory.
>
>Moreover it is significant to note that it is just the most characteristic quantum properties such as nonlocality and undivided wholeness that bring about the classical world with its locality and separability into distinct components. Thus for example, in a measurement tit is the nonlocal quantum potential produced in interaction with what may be a distant piece of apparatus that separates the wave function of the ‘observed system’ into distinct channels that can be treated locally. Similarly, with planets, it is the wave function of the incident radiation with its distant shadow that destroys interference between contributions from different parts of the wave front and thus brings about a simple local behaviour.
>
>In a certain sense we could say that the overall quantum world measures and observes itself. For the classical ‘sub-world’ that contains the apparatus is inseparably contained within the subtle quantum world, especially through those nonlocal interactions that bring about the classical behaviour. In no sense is the ‘observing instrument’ really separate from what is observed. The relative autonomy of the classical level that we have already discussed is then what makes it possible for the total quantum world to manifest and reveal itself within itself in a measurement. Thus in contrast to the classical notion of measurement we should regard a quantum measurement as a manifesting process.
>
>How do we understand what happens when the human being perceives the classical world with its implications, that may simultaneously manifest and reveal the quantum world? The first step is through the sense, which as far as physiological sciences now know, can be explained classically. Sensory impulses are then carried into the brain, and even here a great many processes have been studied which likewise can be understood classically. Most neuroscientists seem to believe however that the brain can be completely treated in terms of classical concepts. At present this is evidently a speculative assumption. However, some neuroscientists, notably Eccles, have suggested that quantum processes may be important in understanding the more subtle activities of the brain. For example as has already been point out, we know that retinal cells respond to a few quanta at a time and that his response leads to a multiplication of their effects to a classical level of intensity. But the retina is just an extension of the brain. There could evidently be other parts of the brain in which such a sensitivity may exist, e.g. in certain kinds of synapses. If this were the case, then the brain would be a system that could, like a measuring apparatus, manifest and reveal aspects of the quantum world in the overall processes. Such quantum sensitivity would imply that in more subtle possibilities of behaviour of the brain, a classical analysis would break down.
>
>All this means that as the processes of perception unfolds into the brain, it may as it were connect to the subtle quantum domain which latter may in turn reconnect to the classical domain, as outgoing action is determined through amplification of quantum effects.
>
>Moreover it does not necessarily follow that quantum effects will only be of importance in the domain of very small energies. For as we have seen it is just through certain kinds of nonlocality that locality can emerge, e.g. in a measuring apparatus. Similar nonlocality may be required for the brain to have a local and essentially classical sub-domain of function.
>
>Finally there is no reason to believe that quantum theory is an ultimate truth. Rather, like other theories, it probably has a limited domain of validity. Indeed various authors including ourselves have already suggested new theories containing quantum theory as an approximation within it and some of these will be discussed in chapter 15. Once again it may well be that a fuller understanding of the brain will require such more extensive theories going beyond the quantum mechanics.

### Chapter 12, on the relativistic invariance of our ontological interpretation [p. 291]

>When all three of these effects are put together, we obtain the Lorentz transformation between length and time as measured by a moving system and those measured by a system at rest in the ether. It follows from this sort of argument that Lorentz invariance is perfectly compatible with the assumption of an absolute frame such as that of the ether. Therefore there is no way from the experimental facts alone to prove there is no absolute frame determining a universal order of succession.
>
>However, for various reasons which were mainly either aesthetic or philosophical, such a notion of a universal time order was rejected early in the twentieth century. For example, the ether theories available at the time assumed very complex and implausible mechanisms to explain the behaviour of fields and physicists found these assumptions unattractive. In addition, the ether theory in the form presented by Lorentz was such that it was impossible to detect its presence by any experiments that could be contemplated at that time. Therefore at the very least such theories were felt not to be very relevant, while by many they were regarded as violating a philosophical principle that was widely accepted in the positivistic atmosphere of the time, i.e. that all concepts contained in any theory ought to be observable.
>
>Nevertheless physics developed in such a way that some features of the ether theory were retained. Thus Einstein in his general theory attributed properties to empty space in the form of the gravitational tensor. Einstein therefore later came to say that his field theories were theories of a relativistic ether that did not involve detailed descriptions of any mechanisms. It was essential for Einstein that such theories should be local and thus he was able to retain Lorentz invariance, at least in regions that were not too large (strictly speaking only in infinitesimal domains described by tangent spaces). But now we have additional reasons to limit Lorentz invariance implying that it does not hold even in the small. And nonlocality further suggest that even in intermediate domains, Lorentz invariance no longer holds for individual processes involving the beables, but is valid only in the manifest domain and in statistical applications of the quantum theory.
>
>The notion of having a domain in which all phenomena become essentially independent of the preferred frame is one that is actually quite familiar in other contexts. For example, consider a cubic crystal which evidently determines a preferred frame, yet large scale properties such as sound waves of long wavelength are isotropic and show essentially no trace of the frame. Similarly we may get Lorentz invariance for long waves even when there is a structure determining a preferred frame.
>
>We have used the ether theory to illustrate how it is possible to retain an absolute time order and yet retain Lorentz invariance. But the same result can be obtained in a much more general way without detailed and implausible assumptions about a material space-filing substratum of the kind to which Einstein objected. For example, one could suppose that in addition to the known types of field there was a new kind of field which would determine a space-like surface along which nonlocal effects would be propagated instantaneously. At present we can say very little about this field, but one could surmise that this space-like surface would be close to a hyperplane of constant time as determined in a certain Lorentz frame. A good candidate for such a frame could be obtained by considering at each point in space-time, the line connecting it to the presumed origin of the universe. This would determine a unique time order for the neighbourhood of that point around which one would expect isotropic properties in space. We may plausibly conjecture that this frame would be the one in which the 3K background radiation in space has an isotropic distribution.
>
>This unique frame would not only make possible a coherent account of nonlocal connections, but could also be significant in other ways. For example in this frame there will evidently be no limit to the possible speed of the particles. Thus, in the stochastic form of the ontological interpretation of the Dirac equation it is possible […] to have random movements that are faster than light. In the unique frame that we have introduced, there evidently is no reason why invariant process of this kind can give a Lorentz invariant equilibrium distribution).
>
>This brings us to the second objection, i.e. that the absolute frame is unobservable. Certainly if we restrict ourselves to the assumptions that have been made thus far, this would be a valid criticism. However, in terms of our ontological approach it is possible to alter these assumptions in such a way that the absolute frame would be observable, while negligible changes would be produced in the domain of experiments that have been possible thus far.
>
>A great many such assumptions are possible, but we shall limit ourselves here to a simple illustration. Our ontological approach allows us, for example, to consider the possibility that the current quantum mechanics is an approximation to a deeper theory (as we shall explain in more detail in chapter 14). Let us assume then that the long range connections of distant systems are not truly nonlocal, as is implied by the quantum theory, but that they are actually carried in the preferred frame at a speed that is finite, but very much greater than that of light. For measurements made at levels of accuracy thus far available, the results will be very close to those predicted by the present quantum theory. But if we can make measurements in periods shorter than those required for the transmission of quantum connections between particles, the correlations predicted by quantum theory will vanish. In effect we would thus be explaining quantum nonlocality as an outcome of a deeper kind of non-Lorentz invariant locality. This however is relevant only in a domain beyond that in which current quantum theory is adequate.
>
>If we consider such modifications of the theory, it then becomes possible to contemplate an experimental test that would reveal the preferred frame. In essence this test would consist of doing an EPR experiment in which the relative time of detection of the two particles was extremely accurately determined. In principle the Bell inequality would then no longer be violated for there would be no time for the disturbance of one particle to propagate to the other before the measurement was made on it. And from this it follows that the latter particle would no longer go into a corresponding state of close correlation with the first one. Of course this will require a measurement of extremely high accuracy because the speed of transmission of the quantum connection is assumed to be very much greater than that of light. It is clear that the accuracy required is far beyond that of the Aspect experiment.
>
>In certain ways this test is reminiscent of the Michelson-Morley experiment but it differs in the crucial respect that what is at issue here is not the measurement of the speed of light, but rather a measurement of the immensely greater speed of propagation of our assumed quantum connection of distant particles. Nevertheless as in the Michelson-Morley experiment, we would have to take into account the speed of the earth relative to the preferred frame. Thus one would have to make measurements in different directions and at different times. If one detected a change between these measurements, one would be able to demonstrate the existence of a preferred frame thus making the latter in principle observable.
>
>However, if such changes were found, this would indicate a failure of both quantum mechanics and relativity, which would be much more significant than the mere observation of the speed of the preferred frame. The meaning of such a result would be that we can eliminate quantum nonlocality provided that we assume a deeper level of reality in which the basic laws are neither those of quantum theory nor of relativity (which latter come out as suitable limiting cases and approximations).
>
>Of course, we cannot at present say any more about what these experiments are that could falsify quantum mechanics and relativity. To say more we would have to develop our ideas in greater detail. We may give here the analogy of the atomic theory which was originally proposed in ancient Greece by Democritus about 2500 years ago. At that time there was very little to guide assumptions about the atoms (e.g. it was proposed that they were held together by ‘hooks’ and that there were atoms of all sorts, such as atoms of intelligence, etc.). In any case it turns out that the experiments available at the time were much too crude to have given any significant information about atoms. It took 2000 years for ideas and experiments to develop far enough to permit some progress in this regard. Nevertheless the idea of atoms was relevant during all this time. What they indicated was that continuity at the large scale could be regarded as an appearance underlying which was the assumed discrete atomic reality. In any domain in which the notion of continuity was adequate atoms could not be observed. However, it was not assumed that atoms were intrinsically unobservable. Indeed the very notion of the atomic theory helped people to be alert to the fact that there might be observable consequences on the large scale which could be explained through these atoms and some of which would not be compatible with the assumption of continuity. Such consequences would provide observable evidence of the atomic constitution of matter.
>
>Similarly with regard to the special frame implied by ‘nonlocal’ quantum connections and the deeper fields that would propagate these connections locally, we do not propose that these are intrinsically unobservable. We merely say that in the statistical and manifest domain in which the current quantum theory and relativity are valid, these new properties cannot be observed. Just as the observation of atoms became possible where continuity broke down, so the observation of the new properties would become possible where quantum theory and relativity break down. But of course it may take some time before we are able to pursue this matter experimentally (and hopefully fewer than 2000 years!).

### Chapter 13, on the many-worlds interpretation [p. 296]

>Over a period of time there have developed a number of other ontological interpretations of the quantum theory. In the next chapter we shall discuss some of these, but here we shall give a more detailed account of one of these which generally goes by the name of the many-worlds interpretation. We are giving this interpretation special attention because it has come to be fairly widely accepted, especially by those who work in general relativity and cosmology and who therefore feel a need to regard the universe as existing in itself whether observed or not.
>
>We must emphasise from the very outset, however, that there is no single generally accepted version of the many-worlds interpretation. Indeed this interpretation has been constantly developing as a result of attempts to clarify its meaning and to remove what are perceived as its inadequacies. In this process a great many ideas have been explored which do not fully agree with each other, and it seems that, as yet, there is no final version of this interpretation that is accepted by all of its protagonists. (For a comprehensive account of this development see Ben-Dov. Further detailed discussions will be found in Ballentine, Bell, Cooper and van Vechten, d’Espagnat, Primas, Stapp, Zeh.) The key difficulty stems from the fact that, as we shall see, the two main protagonists of this interpretation, Everett and DeWitt, differ significantly in their basic formulations, and from this difference further divisions arise from those who have adopted various approaches to deal with the difficulties that these two did not resolve.
>
>We shall begin with a discussion of Everett’s approach to the many-worlds interpretation, which emphasizes the inclusion of observers as purely physical systems within the theory. It seems that in doing this Everett regarded as a kind of spiritual reality beyond that of the material universe and separate from it. (This denial would also include Wigner’s notion of a collapse of the wave function as produced by the interaction between matter and such a mind.)
>
>Everett effectively assumes that the universe as a whole including all observers exists objectively and is described completely by a vector in Hilbert space. Within this universe he wants to attribute subjective states to the observers which are in perfect correspondence with some aspects of the material universe and therefore of Hilbert space. (This sort of idea has been widely called psycho-physical parallelism.) He feels that “it will suffice for his purposes that observers possess memories, i.e. parts of a relatively permanent nature whose states are in correspondence with the past experiences of the observer”. What this means is that, as in a computer whose memories are contained in the state of a disc, some aspect of the physical state of the observer, presumably within his brain, serves as the basis of his memories. Deductions can then in principle be made about the subjective experience of the observer by examining the contents of the memory.
>
>Everett proposes that we can extend this model of an observer by considering him to behave like an automatic machine possessing sensory apparatus coupled to registering devices capable of recording past sensory data as well as machine configurations. He further supposes that the present actions of the machine are determined, not only by its present sensory data, but by the content of its memory as well. Such a machine will be capable of performing a sequence of observations (measurements), and furthermore it will be able to determine its future behaviour on the basis of past results. Everett feels that for such a machine we are justified in using phrases such as “the machine has perceived A” or “the machine is aware of A” if the occurrence of A is recorded in its memory. […]
>
>In order to give the memory a definite state, we would have to have another observation in which the content of this memory was observed. But this would introduce yet another memory of the second observer and the same difficulty would be repeated at one stage removed. It is clear therefore that if we add no further concepts to the quantum theory (e.g. such as well-defined particle positions as we have done and if we do not allow collapse) then there is no way in what Everett has said thus far, to describe the fact that a definite result is actually obtained in each case.
>
>In order to proceed further, some additional assumptions are evidently needed. Everett does not state these assumptions clearly and indeed puts them in such a tacit way that one can readily fail to notice them. However, his essential assumption is implicit in the statement made in a reference. We shall give here a paraphrase of this statement which we feel brings out more directly what we think that Everett wants to say.
>
>In order to avoid the need for bringing about a definite result for the measurement by means of a collapse of the wave function, Everett assumes that each part of this wave function corresponds to a definite state of awareness of the content of the observer’s memory. He says that in one sense, there is only one total awareness belonging to such an observer. Nevertheless he says that (for the case of spin measurement) this single total awareness simultaneously can be regarded as two-fold, and that each of the two partial awarenesses is not aware of the other (nor of course of the whole).
>
>It is evident that in a series of measurements, the number of partial awarenesses must multiply indefinitely. There are correspondingly many possible branches consisting of such sequences of partial awarenesses. He assumes that one of these branches represents the experience of a particular person. The other branches do not represent merely possible experiences responding that this person might have had (as they would, for example, in a corresponding treatment in terms of our own interpretation). Rather they represent distinctly different sequences of experiments which are actually recorded in other awarenesses similar to, but different from, this particular one. We emphasise again that all these different sequences of awareness are not aware of each other, nor of the whole.
>
>Everett assumes that the whole universe including all observers exists objectively and is described, as we have already pointed out, completely and perfectly by a vector in Hilbert space. One may explain what this means loosely by saying that in some sense the universe is regarded as a multi-dimensional reality. But what Everett is doing, is to make a theory that relates the universe to various points of view that are contained within it. What we experience of the universe is a single subsequence of these points of view. Or, as Squires has put it, what we are dealing with is not a many-universe theory, but a theory of one universe with many viewpoints. Each point of view establishes a relationship between a state of awareness and the state of some other part of the universe containing the observing instrument and the observed object.
>
>The existence of this sort of relationship has been described by Everett as a relative state of the system corresponding to a particular state of the observer (or more accurately, to the state of his awareness). Everett and those who follow him seem to regard this notion of relative state as a fundamentally new concept comparable perhaps to Einstein’s regarding the meaning of a position coordinate as being relative to some material system which serves as a frame of reference. Thus in Everett’s language we can say that any part of the total vector in Hilbert space has a perceptible meaning only in relationship to ‘frames’ constituted of the memory of the observer. As there are many permissible coordinate frames in relativity so there are many observer ‘frames’ in quantum theory. […]
>
>It is implicit in Everett’s approach (and as we shall see, this is made explicit in DeWitt’s approach) that the main purpose of this interpretation is to introduce the minimum number of concepts into the theory (for example, Everett would regard our notion of particle variables as further assumptions that are not needed).
>
>It seems to be especially important for Everett to put all the concepts in his theory into correspondence with the basic mathematical structure of the quantum theory, i.e. in terms of Hilbert space. Thus he not only assumes that the physical universe can be described completely in terms of Hilbert space, but he seems to imply that the same is true for mind, which he regards as being in essence just awareness and memory as he has defined them. It must be emphasised however that this in itself is a highly speculative assumption with very little evidence behind it. Everyone agrees that we know very little about mind or conscious awareness, but many would claim that it must include much more than just memory. Even if we accept the as yet unproven assumption that memory can be explained in the way that Everett does, it does not follow that this could be done for the whole of mind which includes attention, sensitivity to incoherence, all sorts of subtle feeling and thoughts and creative imagination as well as much more. We will discuss this in more detail in chapter 15, where we, too, consider the possibility of including the observer in our overall view of the universe. However, we feel that the entire framework of the current quantum theory is too limited to do this property and we propose extensions of the theory that might make a more coherent account of the observer possible.
>
>Perhaps we could put Everett’s hypothesis about the mind into a more favourable light by regarding it as just a convenient simplifying assumption that makes it possible for him to get on with the interpretation of the quantum theory. But even if we do this, we find that there is a further speculative hypothesis of a more physical nature. This is that it is possible to put some quality, such as awareness, into a precise and accurate correspondence with some part or component of the total vector in Hilbert space. Thus for example, […] it would be consistent to say that the memory is well defined […]. The memory would be determined by an eigenvector of what may be called a memory operator. Otherwise the memory has to be ambiguous, just as other properties, such as momentum and position, have to be ambiguous when the Hilbert space vector representing the state of the system is not an eigenvector of the corresponding operators. But Everett is further assuming that there is a property called awareness (which he regards as essentially physical) that can be put into accurate correspondence with some part of the total Hilbert space vector, even when the latter is not an eigenvector of the memory. If a similar statement were made about an ordinary physical quantity, this would imply a violation of the uncertainty principle. Or to put it differently, Everett is assuming that the mind can be aware of its own state of memory without measuring the latter, therefore without disturbing the latter, and hence without introducing any ambiguity. It is clear then that Everett has assumed a kind of property going far beyond what is allowed in the ordinary quantum mechanics. In effect he has introduced a basically speculative theory of mind, along with an equally speculative theory as to how this can be related to a component of a total vector in Hilbert space.
>
>Everett’s approach may well be interesting to pursue further, but it should not be presented as having a smaller number of hypotheses than other interpretations. Even if we do not object to the assumption of a large number of awarenesses undetectable to us or to each other, we must still notice that we are introducing large and unverifiable assumptions about mind and attributing new properties to Hilbert space which go beyond those which follow from ordinary quantum mechanics.
>
>If we accept Everett’s approach in the above spirit, we can then go on to ask whether it is consistent in full detail and whether it deals adequately with all the problems raised in such an approach. We shall in the subsequent sections outline briefly what are the main questions involved and what are the difficulties that arise in doing this.
>
>In this section we shall develop DeWitt’s approach to the many-worlds interpretation and compare it with that of Everett. In doing this we shall see that there are some very important differences between these two approaches. However, the fact that these differences exist appears not to be widely known or recognized, and indeed many authors including DeWitt himself essentially identify the two. The fact that both are commonly given the same name (though Everett did not use the term ‘many-worlds’) helps further to draw attention away from the importance of these differences.
>
>DeWitt’s motivation for his approach is clearly stated in his paper. He felt dissatisfied with all the ‘metaphysical’ assumptions contained in previously available interpretations. He then proposed that we “forget all these” and begin afresh. In particular his intentions were stated as the following:
>
>- To take the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics as it stands without adding anything to it.
>- To deny the existence of a separate classical reality.
>- To assert that the state vector never collapses
>
>He then asserts that it is possible to achieve these intentions and that this was proved by Everett with the encouragement of Wheeler and that this has subsequently been elaborated by Graham. As with Everett, DeWitt starts with the assumption that the mathematical concept of Hilbert space provides the whole of the basic conceptual structure underlying quantum theory. He then says that only one additional postulate is needed to give meaning to the mathematics, namely, the postulate of complexity: “The world must be sufficiently complicated that it can be decomposed into systems and apparatuses”. From this it follows that “the mathematical formalism of the quantum theory is capable of yielding its own interpretation” (and all this without external metaphysics or mathematics).
>
>DeWitt evidently agrees with the implication of Everett’s approach in assuming that the universe is faithfully represented by a vector in Hilbert space. But of course, as he pointed out, this vector must be immensely more complex […]. DeWitt then asserts that the universe itself is splitting into a stupendous number of branches, all resulting from the measurement-like interactions between its myriads of components. Such interactions take place, not only in measurement, but also in natural processes of all kinds which likewise bring about a continual splitting of the universe.
>
>Here we encounter a serious difficulty. For DeWitt clearly attributes his theory to Everett in a number of places. Yet as we have seen there is no mention of splitting universes in Everett’s work. Rather there is one universe with many awarenesses that are not aware of each other. To be sure Everett includes memory which is the content of these awarenesses as part of the total universe. Nevertheless he specifically requires that there be relatively permanent memories without which he could not formulate his notion of awareness. Of course, memory implies a very complex structure, but not every complex structure is a memory. So at the very least, DeWitt should have said that Everett requires a kind of complexity that would provide the basis of memory, e.g. a brain or at least a super computer (as indeed we have seen from Everett’s comparison of awareness of the function of such a machine). But even this would not be enough; Everett also says that no very significant change takes place when an observer becomes aware of a certain result. It is not the universe that splits, but it is just awareness as a whole that divides into many parts that are not aware of each other. We repeat again what Squires has said, i.e. it not a theory of many universes, but a theory of many viewpoints of one universe. Everett’s aim is thus not mainly to explain the universe, but rather to explain our perceptions of the universe.
>
>Everett revealed his attitude to this question in commenting on some views on the quantum theory expressed by Einstein. In the von Neumann interpretation, observation induces a ‘collapse’ of the wave function that my affect the whole universe. Einstein objected to that as implausible and unsatisfactory. At another time Einstein put this feeling colorfully by saying that he could not believe that a mouse could bring about drastic changes in the universe by simply looking at it. In answer to this, Everett says that from the standpoint of his theory, “it is not so much the system that is affected by an observation as it is the observer who becomes correlated to the system”. Furthermore he adds “Only the observer’s state has changed, to become correlated… with the system. The mouse does not affect the universe – only the mouse is affected”.
>
>It is clear from the above that Everett did not contemplate the splitting of the universe. It follows then that there is a fundamental difference between the basic assumptions held by the two leading protagonists of the ‘many-worlds’ approach. Indeed Everett’s view should not even be called the many-worlds interpretation but rather, as Albert and Loewer have suggested, the many-minds interpretation, a view which we discuss later.
>
>The key difference between DeWitt’s approach and that of Everett is that DeWitt’s theory is purely objective, while Everett’s theory depends crucially on the inclusion of the subjective experiences of the observer (which are however explained objectively as being in correspondence with parts of the total Hilbert space vector). For DeWitt, the universe actually splits as might happen to material objects. This assumption creates a number of problems. Firstly we can ask just when does it split. Thus for example, while the spin is interacting with the measuring apparatus […], the wave packets corresponding to the two possible results begin by overlapping. In principle some overlap may persist for a long way even though this may be small. What is it that determines when two overlapping wave packets, originally in one universe, suddenly become two non-overlapping wave packets in separate universes? Indeed unless the measuring apparatus is complex enough to make possible a distinct classical-like result, the universes should never split, as the two wave packets could again come to interfere in the way we have described in chapters 6 and 7. But once the universe has split, it seems that such interferences would no longer be possible. In the usual approach to the quantum theory (as well as in our approach) it is always, in principle, possible for such interference to occur again.
>
>One usually appeals to some feature such as the complex and chaotic phase relations of the wave function to make such interference unlikely to have significant effects. From DeWitt’s emphasis on ‘complexity’, one might suppose that he assumes that when the wave function reaches a certain degree of complication, the universe begins to split. But he does not define complexity (though some authors, notably Leggett, are now exploring how such a definition may be made, but in a different context from that of the many-worlds interpretation). What would be required for an adequate formulation of DeWitt’s approach in this regard would be to come up with a good quantitative definition of complexity and to assume some further equations determining how the splitting of universes is related to this feature of complexity. But if he were to succeed in doing this, he would clearly have introduced new concepts as well as new equations, and could not hope to claim that the mathematics of the current quantum theory determines its own interpretation.
>
>Related to this difficulty is the fact that DeWitt wants to do without a separate classical level and yet he does not suggest anything that could take its place. Nevertheless in describing what he means by an observing apparatus, he tacitly assumes all sorts of properties that are suggested by classical physics, such as the possibility of distinct results which are stable and do not vanish in the quantum uncertainties of the Hilbert space. Perhaps he could also deal with this problem in terms of the notion of complexity if he could show that, with a sufficient degree of the latter, something like a classical world would emerge in a certain limit as we have shown in terms of the quantum potential (see chapter 8). But in the absence of such a demonstration, we have to say that this key part of his basic intention has not been realised (as has indeed been pointed out by Gell-Mann and Hartle). […]
>
>One of the key remaining ambiguities in the basic formulation of the many-worlds interpretation is around the question of how the classical limit is to be treated. As we have seen, DeWitt’s expressed intention was to avoid the assumption of a classical limit. Everett was less clear on this point, but the general tenor of his approach suggests a similar attitude. However, if we accept this then we are required either to show that something like a classical limit is contained implicitly in the many-worlds interpretation or else to show that such a limit is not needed. Yet nothing like this has been done so far in an adequate way. As we have pointed out, DeWitt appeals to an as yet vague notion of complexity and he seems to imply that this would take care of yielding the relatively well-defined and stable kinds of results that are usually comprehended in terms of a classical limit. On the other hand Everett explicitly denies that any such property of complexity is needed. […]
>
>A similar problem can be seen to arise in Everett’s interpretation, but he it involves a certain ambiguity as to what is to be meant by awareness, memory or mind. Thus, for example, Everett’s concept of relative state could be applied to a single hydrogen atom […]. It we were to apply Everett’s theory at this level, we would have to say that the electron is aware of the proton and that the proton is aware of the electron. It would then indeed follow that the overall awareness associated with the hydrogen atom as a whole would split into many correlated states of mutual awareness of the electron and the proton, which states are, however, not aware of each other. This would imply that everything was aware of everything else and that human awareness (or indeed machine awareness) were only special cases of this.
>
>It is certainly not clear what such a theory could mean. If it were Everett’s intention to propose this sort of theory, it would have been up to him to go into what he means by universal awareness of everything by everything. For such a notion is evidently far more radical than anything that arises in the commonly accepted views of the many-worlds interpretation. In the absence of any discussion of this point by Everett or by those who follow him, we must assume that such a radical version of his interpretation was not his intention.
>
>But then this immediately raises the question of just what determines the conditions for awareness to exist. As we have seen, Everett expressly denies that the notion of complexity is basically relevant to his theory. Yet it seems evident because of his referring to computers and memories, that he has tacitly in mind some kind of complexity (as well as stability) as a basis for awareness. This means that he faces essentially the same difficulty as DeWitt. He will have to introduce some new assumptions as to what constitutes the conditions for awareness and new laws determining just when these conditions are satisfied.
>
>Recently these questions have been re-examined by Stapp and by Albert and Loewer in what is called the many-minds interpretation. The key step here is to assume that awareness or consciousness is not basically a physical property, but rather a property of mind which is supposed to be entirely different from matter. Thus the theory, unlike Everett’s, assumes a dualism between mind and matter along lines similar to that proposed much earlier by Descartes. The advantage of this approach is that we do not assume that matter has properties given to it by awareness, i.e. that physical meaning can be given in the quantum theory to all branches of a linear superposition of wave functions without contradicting appearances. It thus makes possible a more consistent way of separating one domain (matter) that satisfies the superposition principle of quantum theory and another domain (mind) that does not.
>
>Such a dualist approach is in certain ways reminiscent of Wigner’s suggestions, but it must be remembered that in the latter, mind and matter are supposed to interact in a two-way process. In the many-minds interpretation however there is no such interaction. Rather mind is assumed to be capable of becoming conscious of certain aspects of the state of matter without influencing the latter in any way at all. […]
>
>All of this is very close to the treatment given by Everett and differs only in that we have further assumed a unique last stage, i.e. mind, in which the linear superposition fails (whereas Everett says nothing about this question). By thus defining this unique last stage as a splitting of the mind and relating this split to the linear superposition of memories in the brain through random processes, the many-minds interpretation avoids difficulties of specifying the basis in which linear superposition breaks down.
>
>On the other hand, this advantage has been gained at the expense of not only brining in duality of mind and matter, but also of having to assume special properties of mind which are difficult to understand, i.e. the ability to be aware of matter without any interaction and the ability to split in a random way into many minds, each of which is associated to a particular physical state.
>
>It should be pointed out here that the many-minds interpretation does not imply nonlocality. This comes about because reality is assumed to be in perfect correspondence with the total wave function of the universe and because the whole of this reality is covered completely by the perceptions of the many minds which have no effect on the wave function. Because Schrödinger’s equation contains only local interactions, its development is entirely local even though it has to be expressed in configuration space. Each mind becomes aware of only one facet of this multidimensional reality.
>
>The perceived classical world is then a result of the fact that each mind is only aware of a small part of the whole, the perceived classical world is in a sense an illusion. What is illusory is that this part is the whole. It If were seen to be merely a facet then there would be no illusion.
>
>To conclude, the many-minds interpretation does remove many of the difficulties with the interpretations of Everett and DeWitt, but requires making a theory of mind basically to account for the phenomena of physics. At present we have no foundations for such a theory. Indeed even to consider the mere possibility of this sort of assumption, we have further to suppose that there are new kinds of laws uniquely relating real physical properties such as awareness, to parts or components of the total vector in Hilbert space. As we have pointed out […] this is equivalent to assuming that the state of awareness is not limited by anything like the uncertainty principle – clearly a gigantic step beyond present day physics. Thus even if we succeed in developing such a theory, it is clear that we will require new principles, new concepts and new equations. This means once again, that the claim of the many-worlds interpretation to avoid the addition of speculative new assumptions will fail.
>
>One of the first objections that tends to arise against the many-worlds interpretation is that its assumption of an infinity of universe or minds, almost all of them being unobservable, violates the principle of Occam’s razor, i.e. that we should not introduce a multiplicity of unnecessary assumptions. However, the proponents of this interpretation answer such objections by saying, e.g. with d’Espagnat, that multiplication of worlds entitles one to economize on principles. Or as Primas has said, “The Everett interpretation is superior in logical economy.” As we have already indicated, they would criticize our interpretation by saying that in addition to postulating the reality of the wave function, it brings in the further concept of particles with their equations of motion. It is thus clear that they feel that the many-worlds interpretation is superior because it does not do this sort of thing.
>
>Leaving aside this question for the moment, it should be said that out interpretation accomplishes a number of things which cannot be done in the many-worlds view. Firstly, as we have seen in chapter 8, it gives a simple and coherent account of why the large scale world of common experience should be essentially classical. This is demonstrated by showing that the quantum theory implies a relatively autonomous domain in which the quantum potential can be neglected so that an approximately classical behaviour will result.
>
>The physical structures of observers are also manifest in this domain. As pointed out in chapter 8, it is a well-known fact that our sensory information comes from this level. From this it follows that we are directly aware of the particle aspect of the universe through the senses and that the more subtle wave function aspect is inferred by though about our sensory experience in the domain that is manifest to the senses. We are therefore not basing our approach on the assumption that we are aware only of particles. Rather we are simply making use of the fact that at least in science as we know it thus far, all information comes not only through the manifest level (recalling that it comes not only through the particles, but also through the classical limit of electromagnetic field beables). […]
>
>It is clear that the many-worlds interpretation cannot do any of these things. As we have seen earlier, it does not provide an adequate account of the large scale behaviour at the classical limit. […] And it gives no intuitively intelligible account of how quantum processes take place.
>
>With regard to the latter point, it defies the imagination to grasp intuitively how the universe could split, and even more as to how it could be doing so in a stupendous number of ways. It equally defies the imagination to grasp intuitively how awareness could split into many parts that are not aware of each other, and even more so how awareness could be, in effect, identified with some part of a vector in Hilbert space.
>
>Let us then consider once again the claim that the many-worlds interpretation is the one that is most economic in concepts and principles. We have seen, however, that in order to introduce probability in a consistent way, Deutsch had to assume an infinity of universes in the same quantum state, and in effect to imply a random distribution of these universes over an undefined parameter whose nature is completely unspecified. As we have pointed out earlier, he has thus in essence replaced the new particle variables by a new parameter that would distinguish the various universes. So there is no advantage in the number of hypotheses. Moreover there is the disadvantage that his new parameters are far less clear in meaning than others.
>
>If we adopt DeWitt’s approach, then, as we have seen, it is necessary to supplement this with some further principles involving perhaps an as yet unavailable definition of complexity and further equations determining just how this would determine the splitting of universes. On the other hand, if we adopt Everett’s approach or indeed that of the many-minds interpretation, we have to do something similar with regard to the splitting of awareness. In this connection a complete and consistent expression of these interpretations would, as we have seen, require new principles and assumptions of a speculative nature going beyond the current quantum theory and beyond our present knowledge of awareness and its possible relationship to Hilbert space.
>
>In view of all these unresolved problems we have been led to ask why the many-worlds interpretation seems to be so attractive to some physicists. Of course we realize that the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics has a great deal of symmetry and may therefore be felt to possess great beauty. Hence it is understandable that there may be great reluctance to give it up or to go beyond it. On this basis one can see that the greatest advantage of the many-worlds interpretation for its proponents is that is provides an ontological formulation which relates all its basic concepts only to Hilbert space. In effect it says that everything can be put in some correspondence with Hilbert space. The first priority is thus to maintain the notion that all basic structures of concepts have to be expressed in terms of Hilbert space. As long as this can be done it is felt that all sorts of further assumptions are possible and that these do not count heavily as new principles. For example the assumption that the mind can be put in correspondence with a component of a vector in Hilbert space is considered to be of minor importance compared with maintaining the universal validity of the concept of Hilbert space itself. Similarly with regard to all the other assumptions that we have outlined here.
>
>We can however ask whether symmetry and beauty are always a sure sign that we have reached an ultimate truth that can never be altered through further enquiry. Indeed in our approach, which we shall explain in more detail in the next chapter, we argue that there is no reason to assume the ultimate truth of any particular feature of knowledge, however beautiful we may feel it to be. Moreover from our discussion of the many-worlds interpretation, which shows that it has not yet fulfilled its claims to economy of principles, it does not seem to be justified to dismiss the assumption of new concepts in our interpretation (such as particle variables) that go beyond what can be accommodated in terms of Hilbert space.
>
>As we have already remarked earlier we feel that the many-worlds interpretation has interesting possibilities, but that its presentation would be greatly clarified if it were frankly admitted that some of its basic hypotheses are of highly speculative nature. Indeed the main motivation behind the many-worlds interpretation is, in our view, not really the minimization of principles and hypotheses. But rather it is to retain Hilbert space as the ground for the basic conceptual structure so that everything in the theory can be formulated in terms of Hilbert space. It could be valuable to develop such a theory but it has to be said that before this is actually done in an adequate way, many as yet unresolved difficulties have to be dealt with. We shall go into this question further in the succeeding chapters.

### Chapter 14, extension of ontological theories beyond the domain of quantum mechanics [p. 319]

>Before going on to a details discussion of our proposals for the extension of quantum mechanics in new ways, we would like to give the outlines of our general world view. This will help make more clear what our motivation is in developing our theories. In addition it should help to clarify certain differences between our attitude towards basic physical and mathematical concepts and that which seems to be behind most of the other approaches.
>
>We shall begin by discussing the latter question first. Thus we have seen in the previous chapter, for example, that the basic attitude in the many-worlds interpretation is to take the present general mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics as the essential truth and to try to derive the physical interpretation as something that is implicit in the mathematics. Many speculative new assumptions have been made within this mathematical framework, but the first priority has been to retain this framework as the ground for the general conceptual structure. Some of the proponents of the many-worlds interpretation, for example, Deutsch as well as Gell-Mann and Hartle, whose work will be discussed further on in this chapter, are even ready, at least in principle, to consider extending their theories beyond the current quantum mechanics. In addition the same may be said of Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber, whose work we will also consider later in this chapter. However, even these authors are in essential agreement that what should not change is the requirement that the Hilbert space (and its natural extension to an infinity of dimensions) would be the basic structure in terms of which all other concepts must be expressed.
>
>This attitude towards the mathematics has not always been dominant in physics. Indeed until the present century, the physical concepts were, for the most part, considered as primary, while mathematical equations were regarded as providing a more detailed and precise way of talking about these physical concepts. However, during the twentieth century with the advent of quantum theory (and to a lesser extent, relativity) the mathematics became much more highly developed and the physical interpretation much more abstract and indirect, as well as much less clear. As a result there was a constantly increasing focus on the mathematics, while the physical ideas were given less and less importance. Thus during the 1920s Sir James Jeans said that God must be a mathematician, implying by this that the universe was constructed on a mathematical plan and that its essence is best grasped in terms of the mathematics itself. Later, Heisenberg went much further along these lines and said very explicitly that the essential truth was in the mathematics. This view has become the common one among most of the modern theoretical physicists who now regard the equations as providing their most immediate contact with nature (the experiments only confirming or refuting the correctness of this contact). So without an equation there is really nothing to talk about. On the other hand, in the past we began talking about our concept of physical reality and used the equations to talk about them.
>
>One of the reasons that our interpretation of the quantum theory may not have been so well understood is perhaps that it is not commonly realised that we have a rather different attitude to the mathematics. Our approach is not simply a return to the notion that the mathematics merely enables us to talk about the physical concepts more precisely. Rather we feel that these two kinds of concepts represent extremes and that it is necessary to be in a process of thinking that moves between these extremes in such a way that they complement each other.
>
>We fully accept that progress can be made from the mathematical side alone, but we feel that to stick indefinitely to this approach is too limited. For example, starting with Schrödinger’s equation expressed in the Hamilton-Jacobi form, we were led in chapter 3 to a new physical concept of a particle which is affected by a quantum field in a way that depends only on the form of the latter and not on its amplitude. With the aid of the concept of active information implied by this behaviour, we can first of all obtain a coherent explanation of the quantum process which gives us new insights into the quantum theory and enables us to understand it in a different way. But we do not regard these physical concepts as mere imaginative displays of the meaning of our equations. Instead, as we shall see in this chapter, we can then move to the other side of this process of thought and take our physical concepts as a guide for the development of new equations. In this way we are engaged in at least the beginning of a kind of thinking in which the clue for a creative new approach may come from either side and may flow indefinitely back and forth between the two sides.
>
>It should be clear from the above that we do not expect to come to the end of this process of discovery (for example, in a form that is currently called the “Theory of Everything”). Rather our view is that nature in its total reality is unlimited, not merely quantitatively, but also qualitatively in its depth and subtlety of laws and processes. Our knowledge at any stage is an abstraction from this total reality and therefore cannot be expected to hold indefinitely when extended into new domains.
>
>In any case it is evident that there is no way to prove that any particular aspect of our knowledge is absolutely correct. Indeed no matter how long it may have demonstrated its validity, it is always possible that later it may be found to have limits. For example, Newtonians physics, which held sway for several centuries, was found to be limited and gave way to quantum theory and relativity. Yet just before this revolution took place at the end of the nineteenth century, Lord Kelvin, one of the leading physicists at the time, advised young people not to go into physics because it was finished and only subject to refinement in the next decimal places. Nevertheless he did point to two small clouds on the horizon, the negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment and the problems of black body radiation. It must be admitted that he chose his clouds correctly, though he totally underestimated their importance. Nowadays physicists are similarly talking about an ultimate unified theory including the four forces and perhaps strings, supersymmetry, etc. that would explain everything. However, it can hardly be said that the clouds in this picture are only two and restricted to being small.
>
>Our notion of the qualitative infinity of nature can usefully be brought out by considering the role of the atomic hypothesis of Democritus which we have already discussed in chapter 12. Not only did this hypothesis show the importance of speculative new concepts going far beyond what could be demonstrated at the time of its proposal, but it also exhibited a further key feature that we would like to emphasise here. This is that deeper explanations often imply the limited validity of what were previously accepted as basic concepts, which later are then recovered only as approximations or limiting cases.
>
>This relationship of concepts is indeed typical of the whole of our experience. For example, as we go round a circular table, what we see immediately is an ever changing elliptical shape. But we have learned to regard this changing shape as a mere appearance, while the essence, i.e. the true being, is considered to be a rigid circular object. This latter is known first in thought, but later this thought is projected into our immediate experience so that the table even appears to be circular.
>
>But further investigation shows that this object is not solid and eventually discloses an atomic structure. The solid object now reverts in our thought to the category of an appearance, while the essence is the set of atoms out of which it is constituted. However, deeper studies then showed that even the atom is an appearance and that the essence is a nucleus surrounded by moving planetary electrons. And later still even these particles were seen to be appearances, while the essence was a set of yet more fundamental particles such as quarks, gluons, preons, or else sets of excitations of strings, etc. But, in all of this development of our knowledge, it seems that whatever we have thought of as matter is turning more and more into empty space with an ever more tenuous structure of moving elements. This tendency is carried further by quantum field theory which treats particles as quantized states of a field that extends over the whole of space.
>
>What has been constant in this overall historical development is a pattern in which at each stage, certain features are regarded as appearance, while others are regarded as of an essence which explains the appearance on a qualitatively different basis. But what is taken as essence at any stage, is seen to be appearance of a still more fundamental essence. Ultimately everything plays both the role of appearance and that of essence. If, as we are suggesting, this pattern never comes to an end, then ultimately all of our thought can be regarded as appearance, not to the senses, but to the mind.
>
>What science is aiming for is that these appearances be correct, i.e. that the actions flowing from them, such as experiments, be coherent with what the appearances would imply. Incorrect appearances are thus either mistaken or illusory. The progress of science then implies the elimination of mistakes and illusions and the development of new sets of related appearances at various levels. Thus with the table to have the appearance of an elliptical object is correct only in a very limited sense. By bringing in the thought that the object is a rigid circle, we obtain a more nearly correct overall set of appearances. The thought of the atomic structure makes the whole set still more nearly correct and so on. Thus was we are doing is constantly extending the appearances with the aid of thought. The ultimate reality is unlimited and unknown, but its successive appearances serve as an ever more accurate guide to coherent action in relation to this reality.
>
>Another way of looking at the notion of appearances is to note that appearances basically are what arise in our perception of the world. As we have seen, the appearances in sense perception give rise to inferences about an essence that might be their origin, but this essence, which is seen in thought, turns out to be yet another appearance and therefore still part of our overall perception. No matter how far we go, we are therefore involved basically in perception. Out theories are not primarily forms of knowledge about the world but rather, they are forms of insight that arise in our attempts to obtain a perception of a deeper nature of reality as a whole. As such we do not expect their development ever to come to an end, any more than we would look forward to a final sense perception. This view of theory as perception can be found in Bohm.
>
>At any stage in the development of perception as described above, there is always further room for new concepts which serve as ways of looking at reality. Such concepts may, in our approach, be either physical or mathematical or both. Thus we do not suppose that physical concepts are merely something to be put in correspondence with the basic mathematical concepts. Nor do we suppose that the mathematical concepts are necessarily subordinate to basic physical concepts. Rather both of these are appearances and their relationships may provide a yet more comprehensive appearance which guides our action towards the unlimited and unknown reality. The imaginative qualitative concept is therefore, in the long run, just as key a feature of this overall appearance as is the precise and abstract mathematical concept. The two together not only present a more comprehensive appearance than either one alone could do, but each can serve as a clue for further development in the other.
>
>In all this, scientific theory may even go so far as to throw some light on the observer, to whom all these appearances are supposed to be taking place. But as with everything else, even such theories are only further extensions of appearances, so to speak, which give the observer a mental mirror in which he or she is reflected. There will therefore be no final theory of the observer. The ultimate nature of awareness is unlimited and unknown, like that of the universe as a whole of which it is a part. In the next chapter, we will make further suggestions as to how the universe can include observers, which are along the lines described above.
>
>It may be readily seen that this general approach implies a certain kind of limit to determinism. For in it, each theory is evidently an abstraction from a totality that is inherently unlimited, both qualitatively and quantitatively. As such, it evidently cannot be entirely self-determines, because it always depends in various ways on what has been left out. So the necessity of its self-determination is only relative and not absolute.
>
>Even here this self-determination may include unstable chaotic orders which approximate randomness. However, even the chaotic or stochastic character may be contingent and determined by conditions in domains not covered by the particular theory in question. For example, random variations in the trajectory of a Brownian particle may be partially or even totally determined by atomic motions at a deeper level.
>
>So ultimately our overall world view is neither absolutely deterministic nor absolutely indeterministic. Rather it implies that these two extremes are abstractions which constitute different views or aspects of the overall set of appearances. Which view is appropriate in a given case will depend both on the unknown totality and on our particular mode of contact with it (e.g. the kinds of experiments we are able to do). So as the situation changes, different views are constantly called for. But the unknown and unlimited essence is not restricted to any of these views. Rather it may be thought of as somewhere between them and ultimately beyond them, as indeed it is beyond what can be captured in thought, which is always limited to some abstraction from the totality […].
>
>The above is a special case of how even our basic concepts and categories of thought are ultimately appearances. If this is so, what then is the point of making an ontological interpretation of the quantum theory? To answer this, we first point out once again that every theory is not only a mere appearance, but that it is more, in the sense that its basic concepts must be said in some sense to reflect reality within its own domain. In other ontological theories suggested thus far in physics, it is either implied or asserted that such basic concepts correspond to independently existent realities, for example, not dependent on context or deeper levels of being. In our approach, however, the basic concept of a given theory may reflect a reality that is inherently dependent either on context or on deeper levels or on both. For example, the elliptical appearances of a circular object may be seen as realities by considering the light coming from the object to the eye and how the eye makes an elliptical image which is in some way carried back into the brain. This we may consider to be an essential part of the reality corresponding to the elliptical appearance. Clearly this reality is not independently existent but depends on a context including the whole process that we have mentioned, as well as much more and particularly on the circular object which is taken to be the essential meaning of the elliptical appearances. But then the circular object is found to be dependent for its existence on a wide range of contextual parameters, e.g. temperature, and especially on the atomic constituents which are considered to be its essence. We find a similar behaviour as we go through a series of deeper essences and appearances.
>
>In particular as we come into the quantum domain, we find that it is necessary to state the relationship between essence and appearance explicitly by considering a totality which includes the measuring instruments as well as what is measured. In this case, the appearances show themselves in the instrument, while the essence is the whole quantum ontology of quantum fields and particles. The reason why the totality must explicitly include the appearances is that there is an irreducible participation of object and observing apparatus in each other in the quantum domain, while in the domains treated by previous theories, the relation between essence and appearance can be neglected or else taken as only implicit.
>
>Because essence and appearance had thus to be considered as a totality, this created a serious problem for the extension of the traditional approach into the domain of the quantum theory. When the quantum was first developed, people did not see how this question could be approached ontologically. Instead there was developed a basically epistemological approach of Bohr, Heisenberg and von Neumann in which the fundamental concepts of the quantum theory were taken as representing only knowledge. The feeling that any other approach was impossible seems to have been grounded in the assumption that any ontological approach would have to have a final essence that was not dependent on anything else at all, so that it would never be necessary to consider essence and appearance as a totality, as we have done.
>
>To sum up, although each form of thought of the essence is an appearance, it also reflects a reality that is however always dependent for its existence as well as for its qualities and properties on broader contexts and deeper levels. This is one of the senses in which the theory is ontological, in spite of the fact that all thought gives appearances. In addition, our approach provides a reflection of reality that is in the form of a totality, including the measuring instruments along with everything else. This does not mean, of course, that it tells us everything about the universe or that it gives a final picture. Rather, as we shall bring out in more detail in the next chapter, one may here use the analogy of a hologram, in which any part of the record gives us information about the whole object rather than a part of it. This feature of our ontological approach is evidently especially important in cosmology and it is also important if it is ever our intention to understand the relation between the observer and the observed.
>
>In addition to all of this, our particular ontological interpretation has the further advantage that it can be grasped more readily in an intuitive and imaginative way than is possible with a basically epistemological interpretation such as, for example, that of Bohr. Besides, as we shall see, it makes possible certain kinds of extensions of the basic equations which would not be possible in a purely epistemological approach. Thus it opens the mind to exploration of new domains which would not be discernible without the ontological concepts. It is not that we want to dismiss the epistemological approach totally, but rather that we feel that both approaches have to be pursued and perhaps ultimately brought into relationship.
>
>Finally the view that our theories constitute appearances does not deny the independent reality of the universe as a whole. Rather it implies that even the appearances are part of this overall reality and make a contribution to it. What we emphasis is, however, that the content of the theory is not by itself the reality, nor can it be in perfect correspondence with the whole of this reality, which is infinite and unknown, but which contains even the processes that make theoretical knowledge possible. It is our view that this approach provides a more coherent understanding of the relationship of theory to the reality towards which it guides us, than do other approaches that are currently available. […]
>
>Without some kind of experimental clue, we are at a loss in this sort of situation as to how to proceed. However, there have been a number of cases in the history of physics in which theoretical questions provided useful clues long before experimental physics was able to do so. A case in point is just the atomic theory of Democritus which we discusses earlier in chapter 2.
>
>The idea of Democritus was inspired by a consideration of a philosophical paradox in the very notion of movement, which was shown by Zeno and another members of the Eleatic school. They demonstrated logical inconsistencies, not only in the idea of movement itself, but also in the idea of an empty space in which movement could take place. From their demonstrations they concluded that only being is and that nonbeing is not, from which it followed that the concepts of becoming along with those of movement and empty space had no meaning.
>
>Through contemplation of this paradox, Democritus was led to a resolution. He proposed that being was discontinuous in the form of distinct and separated atoms, each of which was an indivisible and eternal being. Democritus thus retained, in a certain restricted way, the Eleatic concept of being. But he then postulated that there was an empty space in which these atomic beings could move in such a way that the collective aspect of their motion then explained the large scale properties of apparently continuous matter with its continuous changes. On the other hand if we suppose that matter was truly continuous rather than only apparently so, then, as the Eleatics showed, there was no way in which its movement and transformation could have meaning.
>
>One could, in principle, have seen at that time that the experimental detection of atoms depended basically on two related ways in which the laws of continuous matter could fail, firstly because atoms had a definite size and secondly because they had some non-zero free path between their successive collisions. These were, in fact, actually the ways in which the atomic theory was eventually verified experimentally.
>
>Our proposed ontological explanation of the quantum theory has, as we have seen, also led to a certain paradox. For it implied nonlocality and this would seem to contradict relativity which is regarded as a theory that is equally as fundamental as quantum theory. But as we have seen in chapter 12, it is possible to propose a deeper theory of which nevertheless leads to Lorentz invariant consequences for all statistical results, as well as for the large scale manifest world. In this theory there is a preferred coordinate frame in which the instantaneous transmission of impulses is in principle possible, so that there is no contradiction with nonlocality for individual quantum processes. In other words, we say that underlying the level in which relativity is valid there is a subrelativistic level in which it is not valid even though relativity is recovered in a suitable statistical approximation as well as in the large scale manifest world.
>
>In our discussion of this idea we have already suggested one way in which the theory might imply new experimental consequences. Thus, although there is no inherent limitation to the speed of transmission of impulses in this subrelativistic level, it is quite possible that quantum nonlocal connections might be propagated, not at infinite speeds, but at speeds very much greater than that of light. In this case, as explained in chapter 12, we would expect observable deviations from the predictions of the current quantum theory (e.g. by means of a kind of extension of the Aspect-type experiment).

>It would seem then that already in this case a subrelativistic level would simultaneously be one that goes beyond the current quantum theory. But the notion of a general subquantum mechanical level would have to go beyond the current quantum theory in a much more thoroughgoing way. To explore such a possibility it is useful to consider once again the stochastic form of our ontological approach. We recall that in this approach a particle follows a trajectory which is random, but which is modified by a suitable osmotic velocity along with the action of the quantum potential. At the level of Brownian motion of atoms, for example, similar random trajectories are regarded as approximations to actual trajectories in which this randomness does not prevail at indefinitely short distances. Rather there exists a characteristic length, the mean free path, below which simple causal laws begin to have a dominant effect. This free path reveals itself in many experiment, e.g. those of diffusion, conductivity of heat, etc. Similarly we may propose that in our theory there is a minimum free path below which the trajectory ceases to be random. As the atomic free path is the first sign of a ‘subcontinuous’ domain in which the laws of continuous matter would break down, so the free path in our trajectories would be the first sign of a subquantum domain in which the laws of quantum theory would break down. It is implied of course that this would begin to occur for wavelengths of the order of the ‘free path’.
>
>The next sign of a breakdown of the quantum theory would be the discovery of some yet smaller dimension whose role might be analogous to the dimension of an atom in the atomic explanation of continuous matter. We do not as yet know what this dimension is, but it seems reasonable to propose that it could be of the order of the Planck length, where, in any case, we can expect that our current ideas of space-time and quantum theory might well break down. The ‘free path’ would then some multiple of this length.
>
>At present further progress only seems to be possible through the use of the imagination to suggest new concepts that might permit a more precise formulation of these ideas. In this regard the situation is not very different from what it is in string theory, which is at present guided by speculative use of mathematical concepts, that also have little or no contact with experiment. As we have pointed out […], it took over 2000 years before the atomic theory of Democritus could achieve a more precise formulation. But we may reasonably hope that with the more rapid progress of science in the present era, it will take considerably less time.

### Chapter 15, quantum theory and the implicate order [p. 350]

>Throughout this book we have thus far been concerned mainly with showing that a consistent ontological interpretation of the quantum theory as it now stands is possible. In the previous chapter, however, we raised the question of going beyond the current quantum theory and in the last section we sketched certain more definite proposals for doing this. These proposals however still involve introducing the concept of a particle, in addition to that of the wave function. As we pointed out there, this implies that we go outside the notion of expressing all basic concepts in terms of Hilbert space. In the present chapter we shall begin by exploring a new way of understanding the quantum theory and going beyond it which does not go out of Hilbert space. Nevertheless it does not set aside the work that we have done thus far, but rather it also includes the description of the particle trajectory within the framework of Hilbert space.
>
>The basic idea is to introduce a new concept of order, which we call the implicate order or the enfolded order. This is to be contrasted with our current concepts of order which are bases on the ideas of Descartes who introduced coordinate systems precisely for the purpose of describing and representing order in physical process. The Cartesian grid (extended to curvilinear coordinates), which describes what is essentially a local order, has been the one constant feature of physics in all the fundamental changes that have happened over the past few centuries. In the quantum domain however this order shows its inadequacy, because physical properties cannot be attributed unambiguously to well-defined structures and processes in space-time while remaining within Hilbert space. Thus, for example, the uncertainty principle implied that it is not in general possible to give a definite space-time order to the motion of a particle in its trajectory. The fact that we nevertheless still use Cartesian coordinates, then, leads to a certain difficulty in thinking clearly about the subject. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, this is generally avoided by sticking to the mathematical equations and by saying that, in theoretical physics, these latter are basically what we are talking about, so that unclarities in physical concepts need not disturb us.
>
>What we are proposing here is that this disparity between physical concepts (e.g. particle, wave, position, momentum) and the implications of the mathematical equations arises because the physical concepts are inseparably involved with the Cartesian notion of order, and this violates the essential content of quantum mechanics. What we need is a notion of order for all our concepts, both physical and mathematical, which coheres with this content. In this chapter we shall explore how such coherence may be realised with the aid of the notion of the implicate order which will be developed here.
>
>In some ways this step is similar to that taken in the development of relativity, which likewise introduced new notions of order, e.g. with regard to simultaneity and also with regard to curvilinear coordinates. In relativity however strict continuity and locality are still maintained. But in the implicate order even these will have to be recovered as approximations and limiting cases.
>
>It is generally agreed that neither special relativity nor general relativity have been united with quantum theory in a fully consistent way. To be sure we do have relativistic quantum field theory and with the aid of renormalization techniques, this gives a wide range of correct predictions. Nevertheless the fact remains that strictly speaking the present theory implies various kinds of infinities and that the removal of these infinities by renormalization algorithms is, logically considered, an arbitrary modification of the original basic principles. No new principles have been suggested up to the present that would lead to finite results. It is also very clear that general relativity introduces still further problems of principle which have not yet been resolved.
>
>An important light can be thrown on these difficulties by noting that the basic orders implied in relativity theory and in quantum theory are qualitatively in complete contradiction. Thus relativity requires strict continuity, strict causality and strict locality in the order of the movement of particles and fields. And as we have seen throughout this book, in essence quantum mechanics implies the opposite.
>
>This kind of contradiction in basic concepts is reminiscent of the paradoxes (e.g. Zeno’s paradox) through which Democritus was led to the concept of the atom as explained in the previous chapter. Would it not be possible that the present contradiction between the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory could similarly lead to a qualitatively new idea that would open the way to resolve all these difficulties?
>
>As a clue to what this new idea might be, we could begin by asking, not what are the key differences between these concepts, but rather what they have in common. What they have in common is actually a quality of unbroken wholeness.
>
>To see what this means, let us first consider relativity. As is well known the concept of a permanently existent particle is not consistent with this theory. But rather it is the point event in space-time that is the basic concept. In principle all structures have to be understood as forms in a generalized field which is a function of all the space-time points. In this sort of theory a particle has to be treated either as a singularity in the field, or as a stable pulse of finite extent. The field from each centre decreases with the distance, but it never goes to zero. Therefore ultimately the fields of all the particles will merge to form a single structure that is an unbroken whole.
>
>The notion of unbroken wholeness is, however, still of limited applicability in the theory of relativity, because the basic concept is that of a point event which is distinct and separate from all other point events. In quantum theory however there is a much more thoroughgoing kind of unbroken wholeness. Thus even in the conventional interpretations, one talks of indivisible quantum processes that link different systems in an unanalyzable way. In principle these links should extent to the whole universe, but for practical purposes their effects can be neglected on the large scale, so that in some suitable classical approximation we can use a simplified picture of the world as made up of separate parts in interaction. But in our interpretation there is also the fact that because the quantum potential represents active information, there is a nonlocal connection which can, in principle, make even distant objects into a single system which has an objective quality of unbroken wholeness.
>
>In such a single system, the idea of separate point events clearly has no place. Yet as we have pointed out there is a certain residue of this notion still implicitly present in the fact that ultimately all fields are defined in terms of space-time points. These points are put in order by means of a Cartesian grid (extended where necessary to curvilinear coordinates), and it is this order that makes it possible to define key concepts such as local interaction between fields and differential operators which play an essential role in expressing the movements of these fields.
>
>To sum up then, relativity and quantum theory share the notion of unbroken wholeness even though they achieve this in very different ways. As we have already explained in the previous section, we need a new notion of order that will encompass these different kinds of unbroken wholeness, which could open the way for new physical content that includes relativity and quantum theory but has the possibility of going beyond both.
>
>Our notions of order in physics have generally been tacit rather than explicit and have been manifested in particular forms which have developed gradually over the centuries in a somewhat fortuitous way. These latter have, in turn, come out of intuitive forms and common experience. For example, there is the order of numbers (which is in correspondence to that of points on a line), the order of successive positions in the motion of objects, various kinds of intensive order such as pressure, temperature, color etc. Then there are more subtle orders such as the order of language, the order of logic, the order in music, the order of sensations and thought etc. Indeed the notion of order as a whole is not only vast, but it is also probably incapable of complete definition, if only because some kind of order is presupposed in everything we do, including, for example, the very act of defining order. How then can we proceed? The suggestion is that we can proceed as in fact has always been done, by beginning with our common intuitive notions and general experience of order and by letting these develop so as to extend into new domains and fields of application.
>
>Our suggested next step is to explore how an order appropriate to wholeness can be found in our intuition and general experience. We begin by noting that the ordinary Cartesian order applying to separate points, finds one of its strongest supports in the function of a lens. What a lens does is to produce an approximate correspondence of points on an object to points on its image. The perception of this correspondence strongly brings out attention to the separate points. But as is well known, there is a new instrument used to making images called the hologram which does not do this. Rather each region of the hologram makes possible an image of the whole object. When we put all these regions together, we still obtain an image of the whole object, but one that is more sharply defined as well as containing more points of view.
>
>The hologram does not look like the object at all, but gives rise to an image only when it is suitably illuminated. The hologram seems, on cursory inspection, to have no significant order in it, and yet there must somehow be in it an order that determines the order of points that will appear in the image when it is illuminated. We may call this order implicit, but the basic root of the word implicit means ‘enfolded’. So in some sense, the whole object is enfolded in each part of the hologram rather than being in point-to-point correspondence. We may therefore say that each part of the hologram contains an enfolded order essentially similar to that of the object and yet obviously different in form.
>
>As we develop this idea, we shall see that this notion of enfoldment is not merely a metaphor, but that is has to be taken fairly literally. To emphasis this point, we shall therefore say that the order in the hologram is implicate. The order in the object, as well as in the image, will then be unfolded, and we shall call it explicate. The process, in this case wave movement, in which this order is conveyed from the object to the hologram will be called enfoldment or implication. The process in which the order in the hologram becomes manifest to the viewer in an image will be called unfoldment or explication.
>
>Enfoldment and unfoldment are actually encountered quite commonly in ordinary experience. For example, whenever one stands in a room, the order of the whole room is enfolded into each small region of space, and this includes the pupil of an eye which may happen to be there. This latter order is unfolded onto the retina and into the brain and nervous system, so as to give rise somehow to a conscious awareness of the order of the whole room. Similarly the order of the whole universe is enfolded into each region and may be picked up in various instruments, such as telescopes, from which they are ultimately unfolded to a conscious awareness of this order. The fact that light and other such processes are constantly enfolding and unfolding the whole is crucial for our ability to learn about any part of the universe of space and time, no matter where and when our observations may take place.
>
>The notions of enfoldment and unfoldment can be understood in terms of the Cartesian order as being only particular cases of movements of fields not having the kind of general necessity that we would attribute, for example, to laws of nature. Rather what is significant for such laws of physics is considered to be the order of separate points. What we are proposing here is to turn this notion upside down and say that the implicate order will have the kind of general necessity that is suitable for expressing the basic laws of physics, while the explicate order will be important within this approach only as a particular case of the general order.
>
>How can we justify such a radical change in our point of view? First of all we not that basically all the laws of movement in quantum mechanics do correspond to enfoldment and unfoldment. In particular the relation between the wave function at one time and its form at another time is determined by the propagator or the Green’s function. […]
>
>Of course the Green’s function has been derived ultimately from the Cartesian order by solving differential equations. But if we are questioning that this order holds fundamentally (especially at short distances), we may well adopt the point of view that the Green’s function is more basic than the differential equation (which latter will only be an approximation). In this case the order of enfoldment and unfoldment will be fundamental, while the Cartesian order will have a relatively limited kind of significance.
>
>The process of enfoldment and unfoldment was already well known implicitly in the Huygens’ construction. Waves from each point unfold. But at the same time waves from many points are enfolding to give rise to a new wave front. So in the totality, the one process includes both enfoldment and unfoldment. It is only when we focus on a part that we are led to talk of these as distinct. […]
>
>We may suppose that the universe, which includes the whole of existence, contains not only all the fields that are now known, but also an indefinitely large set of further fields that are unknown and indeed may never be known in their totality. Recalling that the essential qualities of fields exist only in their movement we propose to call this ground the holomovement. It follows that ultimately everything in the explicate order of a common experience arises from the holomovement. Whatever persists with a constant form is sustained as the unfoldment of a recurrent and stable pattern which is constantly being renewed by enfoldment and dissolved by unfoldment. When the renewable ceases the form vanishes.
>
>The notion of a permanently extant entity with a given identity, whether this be a particle or anything else, is therefore at best an approximation holding only in suitable limiting cases. […]
>
>The general case is one in which there is a succession of explicate structures enfolded to make up what is basically an intrinsically implicate order. However, this latter contains explicate suborders as aspects which are particular cases of the general notion of the implicate order. In this way we clarify our earlier statement that the implicate order is general and necessary, while explicate orders are particular and contingent cases of this.
>
>What then is the relationship between the notion of explicate order and that of the manifest world discussed in chapter 8? Clearly the manifest world of common sense experience refined where necessary with the aid of the concepts and laws of classical physics is basically in an explicate order. But the motion of particles at the quantum level is evidently also in an explicate order. However, as we have suggested in chapter 8, this latter order is not always at the manifest level because it is profoundly affected by the active information represented by the quantum potential. This latter operates in a subtle way and according to what has been said in this chapter, this operation is in an implicate order. Therefore the particle movement is not understood fully as self-determined in the explicate order in which it is described. Rather, this explicate order reveals the deeper implicate order underlying its behaviour.
>
>The movement of the beables becomes manifest only at the large scale level under conditions in which the quantum potential can be neglected. In this case the movement is not only describable in an explicate way, but it can be approximated as self-determined in the same explicate order that we use to describe it. Therefore it is essentially independent of the implicate order and can be abstracted as existing on its own. It is therefore capable of being ‘grasped in the hand’ without fundamental alteration (whereas at the micro-level, the movement of particles is not). Nevertheless, as we have seen in chapter 8, the implicate order is still revealed in the manifest world in some of the more subtle relationships that arise in experiments at a quantum level of accuracy (e.g. interference experiments). […]
>
>We are now ready to extent the model of a particle in our interpretation so that it can be included within the framework of Hilbert space. We shall see that this model has certain similarities with the models of Stapp and Gell-Mann and Hartle, though there are important differences that we shall bring out as we go along.
>
>We shall begin by returning to our ink droplet model of a particle. We can now relate this to the extension of our approach beyond the domain of current quantum theory as suggested in chapter 14. We proposed there that the stochastic trajectories in our interpretation can be thought of as arising from some random process with a certain free ‘flight-time’ that is related to the Planck time. So what we now suggest is to give up the idea that the particle has a continuous existence and to suppose instead that it is more like our ink droplet model, which is continually unfolding and re-enfolding. The time between these processes should be of the order of this mean free time. […]
>
>Gell-Mann and Hartle propose actual histories […] to describe an essentially classical-type development of actual events. Our proposal is to consider a sequence of actual events forming a ‘trajectory’ which is essentially quantum mechanical. So in some sense we have quantum mechanical histories and they have classical histories. The advantages of our approach have been discussed earlier throughout this book, but here we recall two of them. First there is no sharp distinction of classical and quantum levels. The classical level arises naturally without further assumptions in a gradual way as the quantum potential becomes negligible. On the other hand, in the approach of Gell-Mann and Hartle, we have simply to assume such a distinction of classical and quantum levels without having, as yet, a clear criterion for what are the limits of the classical level. Secondly our approach gives a simple and fairly clear account of quantum processes as well as providing an intuitive understanding of all the transformations of the theory in terms of the implicate order. On the other hand, in their approach, the individual quantum process cannot be described and therefore there is no intuitive understanding of what it means.
>
>The dependence of the points to which the various successive waves converge on some sort of systematic drift velocity and osmotic velocity provides an explanation of the ‘inertia’ of the particle. It is this dependence which also guarantees that a particle will not enter a region of zero wave function and will not leave its channel once it enters. In this way definite results can be preserved at the manifest level which includes the observable outcomes of measurements.
>
>The notion of a particle with permanent identity has now been replaced by that of a particle with no permanent identity. Rather its basic ‘elements’ are constantly forming and dissolving in succession. Over times much longer than that between successive wave formations, the whole process approximates a trajectory (which may however be engaged in a stochastic process). For shorter times the notion of a trajectory dissolves away and some entirely new concepts will be needed which we shall discuss. (Further on, we shall give an example of these in terms of incoming and outgoing waves.) […]
>
>In the previous two sections we have proposed how the notion of a continuous trajectory can be replaced by that of a succession of waves, each converging to a point, and how this succession can be seen as a structure in the implicate order. However, the equivalence of this model to a particle is limited. Because for times shorter than that between successive waves, the idea of a particle is no longer relevant.
>
>It seems natural to suppose that, as we have suggested earlier, the critical time in this regard is the Planck time. For such intervals the ordinary notions of space-time and the structure of matter will in any case probably break down because of quantum fluctuations of the metrical field. Indeed the notion of measurability of space-time in the usual way could hardly be expected to be applicable under such conditions. Rather we may anticipate that the implicate order would become the dominant and fundamental concept here.
>
>We have thus far seen throughout this book how it is possible, not only for the manifest level of ordinary experience, but also the quantum level of underlying it, to emerge from a still deeper implicate level in which the classical Cartesian notions of form, order and structure have more or less dissolved. Indeed it was implicit in the previous two sections that such ideas, underlying our classical notions of space-time and measure, would have to arise as limiting cases of this deeper implicate order. In many ways this suggestion is close to one that has been under consideration recently by physicists, i.e. that of ‘pre-space’. The difference is that we want to go much further than has generally been contemplated in the discussion of pre-space and to propose more definite lines along which we could actually enquire into developing an overall mathematical formulation of these ideas.
>
>We have space in this book only for a brief sketch of our proposals. A number of preliminary papers on this subject have already been published and further work is proceeding.
>
>The principal current difficulty in the attempt to make theoretical physics coherent is the notion of a mathematical point in space-time without extension or duration. This has been very useful as an abstraction, but we feel that there is a great deal of evidence (some of which we have discusses in this book) that this notion has reached its limits of validity and usefulness. The idea of beginning with an extended region has indeed been long in the air and has been explored by many people. Indeed both Stapp and Gell-Mann and Hartle have at least implicitly begun with this notion by considering projection operators that cover regions. […]
>
>This means that we have a ‘space’ which may be ‘locally explicate’ but which gradually enfolds as we move along the locally ordered lines. To picture this we can say that ‘wherever you are’ you may represent this as an ‘ordinary local space’ but that there will be a horizon in which this space ‘dissolves’ into an implicate order. Such a ‘universe’ would not have a definite boundary, but would simply fade into something that does not manifest to us beyond its horizon. Nor would it have a beginning or an end. But rather it would similarly fade in the distant past and in the distant future. Yet, to anyone that was beyond our horizon, everything would be as definite (or indefinite) as it is to us. That is to say, there is a kind of relativity of the implicate order. Some new mathematical concept corresponding to curvature would have to be developed to express more precisely the distinction between and irreducibly implicate order and one that could be transformed as a whole into an explicate order. […]
>
>We have been discussing how explicate orders, or approximations to such orders, could emerge from a ground that was irreducibly implicate as a whole. This is an example of how an explicate order arises as a particular case of the implicate order. […]
>
>Thus far we have been considering the implicate order mainly in relation to particle theories, but further interesting insights can be obtained by extending the notion of implicate order to quantum field theories.
>
The classical field, which generally obeys a linear equation, has already been understood in terms of the implicate order, e.g. as in the example of the hologram. But when this field is quantized, a further kind of implicate order is introduced. We shall call this the super implicate order. The super implicate order is related to the implicate order as the implicate order, in particle theories, is related to the particles. […]
>
>As in the particle theory, the implicate order manifests in the activity of the particle through the quantum potential. It is clear then that in field theory there is a super implicate order that manifests in the field beables.
>
>The effect of the implicate order on the particle is to make its behaviour more wave-like than it would be in classical physics. However, as we have seen in chapter 11, the effect of the super implicate order on the field beables is to oppose the classical tendency for waves to spread and to cause the wave field to be ‘swept in’ towards atoms, for example. The beables may now be regarded as the first implicate order. The super implicate order thus tends to organize the first implicate order into something more particle-like than it would be in classical physics.
>
>At this point a little reflection shows that the whole idea of implicate order could be extended in a natural way. For if there are two levels of implicate order, why should there not be more? Thus if we regard the super implicate order as the second level, then we might consider a third level which was related to the second as the second is to the first. That is to say, the third implicate order would organize the second which would thereby become nonlinear. (For example there might be a tendency for the whole quantum state to collapse into something more definite.)
>
>Evidently we could go on indefinitely to high levels of implicate order. Since each is related to the one below, as the one below is related to the one still further below, we have a sequence of similar differences. In other words we have an order of implicate orders.
>
>Thus far we have considered only a one-way connection of implicate orders in which the higher affects the lower but not the other way round. However, we could quite readily extend the idea to allow lower orders to affecter the higher ones. At present we have very little to guide us as to how to do this, but we have indeed already considered a possibility of this kind. […]
>
>To develop such an order of implicate orders would require that we first obtain some notion of the third implicate order. At present there is very little to guide any speculations about this. It is however an interesting possibility that may be kept in mind for further exploration. The main suggestion that we have, at present, is that a third implicate order would require a superwave functional. This would imply that the wave function is spread over a range of possibilities. But the notion of a density matrix can be thought of as implying the same sort of thing, i.e. a statistical spread over wave functions or over wave functionals. If the density matrix were thus connected to the superwave functional, this would mean, for example, that a state of thermal equilibrium spreading over a range of energies is actually a reflection of some new property that flows out of the superwave functional.
>
>Another possible area in which the super implicate order may be relevant is in consciousness as will be brought out in the next section of this chapter.
>
>Several physicists have already suggested that quantum mechanics and consciousness are closely related and that the understanding of the quantum formalism requires that ultimately we bring in consciousness in some role or other (e.g. Wigner, Everett and Squires). Throughout this book it has been our position that the quantum theory itself can be understood without bringing in consciousness and that as far as research in physics is concerned, at least in the present general period, this is probably the best approach. However, the intuition that consciousness and quantum theory are in some sense related seems to be a good one, and for this reason we feel that it is appropriate to include in this book a discussion of what this relationship might be.
>
>Our proposal in this regard is that the basic relationship of quantum theory and consciousness is that they have the implicate order in common. The essential features of the implicate order are, as we have seen, that the whole universe is in some way enfolded in everything and that each thing is enfolded in the whole. However, under typical conditions of ordinary experience, there is a great deal of relative independence of things, so that they may be abstracted as separately existent, outside of each other, and only externally related. However, more fundamentally the enfoldment relationship is active and essential to what each thing is, so that it is internally related to the whole and therefore to everything else. Nevertheless, the explicate order, which dominates ordinary ‘common sense’ experience as well as classical physics, appears to stand by itself. But actually this is only an approximation and it cannot be properly understood apart from its ground in the primary reality of the implicate order, i.e. the holomovement. All things found in the explicate order emerge from the holomovement and ultimately fall back into it. They endure only for some time, and while they last, their existence is sustained in a constant process of unfoldment and re-enfoldment, which gives rise to their relatively stable and independent forms in the explicate order.
>
>It takes only a little reflection to see that a similar sort of description will apply even more directly and obviously to consciousness, with its constant flow of evanescent thoughts, feelings, desires, urges and impulses. All of these flow into and out of each other and, in a certain sense, enfold each other (as, for example, we may say that one thought is implicit in another, nothing that this word literally means enfolded).
>
>A very clear illustrative example of this enfoldment can be seen by considering what takes place when one is listening to music. At a given moment, a certain note is being played, but a number of the previous notes are still ‘reverberating’ in consciousness. Close attention will show that it is the simultaneous presence and activity of all these related reverberations that is responsible for the direct and immediately felt sense of movement, flow and continuity, as well as for the apprehension of the general meaning of the music. To hear a set of notes so far apart in time that there is no consciousness of such reverberation will destroy altogether the sense of a whole unbroken living movement that gives meaning and force to what is being heard.
>
>The sense of order in the above experience is very similar to what is implied in our model of a particle as a sequence of successive incoming and outgoing waves. We saw how a particle trajectory could be expressed at a given moment in terms of an order of spherical waves that are present at that moment. Here the outgoing waves would correspond to ‘reverberations’, while the incoming waves would correspond to anticipations (which are also evidently present as we listen to the music). The essential point is that the whole movement is contained in this way at any given moment.
>
>Of course not all of it is conscious at any given moment and a great deal may be unconscious. But even that which is unconscious and vaguely anticipatory may contain a whole movement. The most striking example of this is Mozart saying that the whole composition came to him almost in a flash and that from there on he was simply able to play it or to write it. Thus the whole was unfolded rather as the sequence of spheres is unfolded in our model.
>
>Further similar examples can be obtained from visual experiences (e.g. as a series of similar frames in a movie sensed simultaneously can give rise to a feeling of movement). What all this suggests is that our most primary experience in consciousness actually is of an implicate order. And our perception of the explicate order is constituted mostly by a series of abstractions from this. […] To sum up then, in consciousness, as in quantum theory, the explicate order emerges from the implicate order as a relatively stable and self-determined domain and ultimately flows back into the implicate order.
>
>The implicate order is not only the ground of perception, but also of the actual process of thought. For thought is based on information contained in the memory. We do not know a great deal of how memory works at present, but it does not seem that it operates through a one to one correspondence between, for example, an object and an image stored somewhere in the brain. Rather what is relevant for thought is the storage of many abstracted items of information, for example, about shape, color, the uses of the object, the various things with which it is associated, etc. Indeed in our customary use of language we say that a certain content is re-collected, thus suggesting that this content is collected together from the whole of memory. The fact that it does seem to come from the whole can be seen with the aid of an elementary example. Thus English nouns ending in ‘-ation’ generally come from verbs ending in ‘-ate’. Thus ‘rotation’ comes from ‘rotate’. But this rule does not always hold. For example ‘inclination’ does not come from ‘inclinate’. The crucial point here is that we can tell immediately that ‘inclinate’ is not an accepted word, whereas ‘rotate’ is. This strongly suggests that somehow our ‘re-collection’ is directly from a whole rather than the result of an algorithm for searching the memory in detail.
>
>All of this is clearly compatible with the notion that the basic order of the mind is implicate and that the explicate arises as a particular case of this implicate order in much the way that we have suggested in this chapter for the quantum theory and for pre-space. So the various items of information that have been stored up may be regarded as somehow enfolded in the brain and indeed probably in the rest of the nervous system as well as in the muscles and organs.
>
>It is clear moreover that this information is basically active rather than passive. We may easily verify this in our subjective experience. Suppose, for example, that on a dark night one encounters some shadows. If the memory contains information that there may be assailants in the neighbourhood this can give rise immediately to a sense of danger, with a whole range of possibilities (fight, flight, etc.). This is not what could be called purely a mental process, but includes an involuntary and essentially unconscious process of hormones, heartbeat and neuro-chemicals of various kinds, as well as physical tensions and movements. However, if we look again and we see that it is only a shadow that confronts us, this thought has a calming effect and all this activity ceases. Such a response to information is extremely common (e.g. information that ‘X’ is a friend or enemy, good or bad etc.). More generally in consciousness, information is seen to be active in all these ways physically, chemically, electrically etc.

>This sort of activity is evidently similar to that which was described in connection with quantum processes involving particles such as electrons, for which the information in the wave function was also active in the movement of the particle. At first sight, however, there may still seem to be a significant difference between these two cases. Thus, in our subjective experience, action can, in some case at least, be mediated by reflection in conscious thought. On the other hand, in the case of the electron, the action of information is immediate. But actually, even if this happens, the difference is not as great as it might appear to be. For such reflection follows on the suspension of physical action. This gives rise to a train of thought. However, both a suspension of physical action and the resulting train of thought follow immediately from a further kind of active information implying the need to do this.
>
>It seems clear from all this that at least in the context of the processes of thought, there is a kind of active information that is operating which is in key ways rather similar to that which operates in the action of the quantum potential. To clarify what this means in the present context, it is convenient to introduce the notion that consciousness shows or manifests on two sides which may be called the physical and the mental. Active information can serve as a kind of link or ‘bridge’ between these two sides. These latter are however inseparable, in the sense, for example, that information contained in thought, which we feel to be on the mental side, is at the same time a related neurophysiological, chemical and physical activity (which is clearly what is meant by the ‘material’ side of thought).
>
>We have however up to this point considered only a small part of the significance of thought. Thus, our thoughts may contain a whole range of information content of different kinds. This may in turn be surveyed by a higher level of mental activity, as if it were a material object at which one were ‘looking’. Out of this may emerge a yet more subtle level of information, whose meaning is an activity that is able to organize the original set of information into a greater whole. But even more subtle information of this kind can, in turn, be surveyed by a yet more subtle level of mental activity, and at least in principle this can go on indefinitely. Each of these levels may then be seen from both sides. From the mental side, it is a potentially active information content. But from the material side, it is an actual activity that operates to organize the less subtle levels, and the latter serve as the ‘material’ on which such operation takes place.
>
>The proposal is then that a similar relationship holds at indefinitely great levels of subtlety. It is being suggested that this possibility of going beyond any specifiable level of subtlety is the essential feature on which the possibility of intelligence is based.
>
>It is interesting in this context to consider again the meaning of the word ‘subtle’. As stated in chapter 8, this is “rarefied, highly refined, delicate, elusive, indefinable”; its Latin root is sub-texere, which mean “finely woven”. This suggests a metaphor for thought as a series of more and more closely woven nets. Each can ‘catch’ a certain content of a corresponding ‘fineness’. The finer nets cannot only show up the details of form and structure of what is ‘caught’ in the coarser nets; they can also hold within them a further content that is implied in the latter. We have thus been led to an extension of the notion of implicate order, in which we have a series of inter-related levels. In these, the more subtle – i.e. ‘the more finely woven’ levels including thought, feeling and physical reactions – both unfold and enfold those that are less subtle (i.e. ‘more coarsely woven’). In this series, the mental side corresponds, of course, to what is more subtle and the physical side as we move in the direction of greater subtlety.
>
>Let us now return to a consideration of the quantum theory. We have already seen that there is a basic similarity between the quantum behaviour of a system of electrons for example and behaviour of mind. But if we wish to relate mental processes with quantum theory, this similarity will have to be extended. The simplest way of doing this is to use the idea of a series of implicate orders for matter in a way that has already been discussed in the previous section. So we are supposing that, like mental processes, physical processes are also capable of extension to indefinitely great levels of subtlety in a series of implicate orders with two-way relationships.
>
>One may then ask what is the relationship between the physical and the mental processes? The answer that we propose here is that there are not two processes. Rather, it is being suggested that both are essentially the same. This means that that which we experience as mind, in its movement through various levels of subtlety, will, in a natural way ultimately move the body by reaching the level of the quantum potential and of the ‘dance’ of the particles. There is no unbridgeable gap or barrier between any of these levels. Rather, at each stage some kind of information is the bridge. This implies that the quantum potential acting on atomic particles, for example, represents only one stage in the process.
>
>The content of our own consciousness is then some part of this overall process. It is thus implied that in some sense a rudimentary mind-like quality is present even at the level of particle physics, and that as we go to subtler levels, this mind-like quality becomes stronger and more developed. Each kind and level of mind may have a relative autonomy and stability. One may then describe the essential mode of relationship of all of these as participation, recalling that this word has to basic meanings, to ‘partake of’ and to ‘take part in’. Through enfoldment, each relatively autonomous level of mind partakes of the whole to one degree or another. Through this it partakes of all the others in its ‘gathering’ of information. And through the activity of this information, it similarly takes part in the whole and in every part. It is in this sort of activity that the content of the more subtle and implicate levels is unfolded (e.g. as the movement of the particle unfolds the meaning of the information that is implicit in the quantum field and as the movement of the body unfolds what is implicit in subtler levels of thought, feeling, etc.).
>
>For the human being, all of this implied a thoroughgoing wholeness, in which mental and physical sides participate very closely in each other. Likewise, intellect, emotion, and the whole state of the body are in a similar flux of fundamental participation. Thus, there is no real division between mind and matter, psyche and soma. The common term psychosomatic is in this way seen misleading, as it suggests the Cartesian notion of two distinct substances in some kind of interaction.
>
>Extending this view, we see that each human being similarly participates in an inseparable way in society and in the planet as a whole. What may be suggested further is that such participation goes on to a greater collective mind, and perhaps ultimately to some yet more comprehensive mind in principle capable of going indefinitely beyond even the human species as a whole.
>
>Finally, we may ask how we can understand this theory if the subtle levels are carried to infinity. Does the goal of comprehension constantly recede as we try to do this? We suggest that the appearance of such a recession is in essence just a feature of our language, which tends to give too much emphasis to the analytic side of our thought processes.
>
>To explain what is meant here, one may consider the analogy of the poles of a magnet, which are likewise a feature of linguistic and intellectual analysis, and have no independent existence outside such analysis. At every part of a magnet there is a potential pair of north and south poles that overlap each other. But these magnetic poles are actually abstractions, introduced for convenience of thinking about what is going on, while the whole process is a deeper reality – an unbroken magnetic field that is present over all space.
>
>Similarly, we may for the sake of thinking about the subject, abstract any given level of subtlety out of the unbroken whole of reality and focus our attention on it. At each such level, there will be a ‘mental pole’ and a ‘physical pole’. Thus as we have already implied, even an electron has at least a rudimentary mental pole, represented mathematically by the quantum potential. Vice versa, as we have seen, even subtle mental processes have a physical pole. But the deeper reality is something beyond either mind or matter, both of which are only aspects that serve as terms for analysis.
>
>See Marshall for an account of an idea having important similarities with what has been proposed here. He, too, uses the notion of a general quantum reality as a basis for the bodily and mental realms, considered as inseparable sides or aspects. But he proposes to explain this from the quantum theory as it now stands in its usual interpretation. However, we have here used the ontological interpretation of the quantum theory with its additional concepts of particle trajectories and active information, and have assumed that ultimately the relationship of mental and material sides can be understood only by extending the scheme beyond the domain in which the current quantum theory is valid.
>
>For other recent attempts to consider the mind-matter relation in the light of the quantum theory, see Penrose and Lockwood. For a discussion of the notions of active information and implicate order by a number of authors, see Pylkkänen.
>
>These can contribute to our understanding of what is happening but are in no sense separate substances in interaction. Nor are we reducing one pole to a mere function or aspect of the other (e.g. as is done in materialism and in idealism). The key point is, however, that before the advent of the quantum theory, our knowledge of matter as gained from the study of physics would have led us to deny that it could have a mental pole, which would enable it to participate with mind in the relationship that has been described here. We can now say that this knowledge of matter (as well as of mind) has changed in such a way as to support the approach that has been described here. To pursue this approach further might perhaps enable us to extend our knowledge of both poles into new domains.
>
>What we have done here opens up the possibility of an overall approach that encompasses all aspects of objective nature and of our subjective experience (e.g. as an observer and a thinker). To develop such an approach, we first note that not only inanimate nature, but also living nature, is to be understood in terms of the implicate order. Consider a tree, for example, which grows from a seed. Actually the seed makes a negligible contribution to the material substance of the plant and to the energy needed to make it grow. The substance comes from the air, water and soil, while the energy comes from the sun. In the absence of a seed, all these move in an implicate order of a relatively low level of subtlety (based, for example, on the order of the constituent particles). This brings about the constant re-creation of inanimate matter in various forms. However, through the information contained in the DNA molecule, the overall process is subtly altered so that it produces a living tree instead. All the streams of matter and energy which had hitherto developed in an unorganized way, now begin to bring substance and energy to the plant, which grows and eventually decays to fall back into inanimate matter.
>
>At no stage is there a break in this process. For example one would not wish to say that an ‘intimate’ molecule of carbon dioxide enters the tree and suddenly becomes ‘alive’, or that the oxygen molecule suddenly ‘dies’ when it leaves the tree. Rather, life is eternally enfolded in matter and more deeply in the underlying ground of a generalized holomovement as is mind and consciousness. Under suitable conditions, all of these unfold and evolve to become manifest in ever higher stages of organization.
>
>The notion of a separate organism is clearly an abstraction, as is also its boundary. Underlying all this is unbroken wholeness even though our civilization has developed in such a way as to strongly emphasise the separation into parts.
>
>In this whole process, it is clear that the observer along with his thoughts is contained in an inseparable way. For example, the general theories of physics (including the very one we are proposing here) are an extension of this process. What such a theory produces is a kind of reflection of reality as a whole. As explained in chapter 14, this provides another aspect or appearance of the whole. We may usefully regard this appearance as a kind of mirror through which reality is perceived. Classical physics provided a mirror that reflected only the objective structure of the human being who was the observer. There is no room in this scheme for his mental process which is thus regarded as separate or as a mere ‘epiphenomenon’ of the objective processes. As we have seen throughout this book, however, quantum physics interpreted ontologically and extended in a natural way makes possible a reflection even of the subtle mental aspects of the observer. Thus through this mirror the observer sees ‘himself’ both physically and mentally in the larger setting of the universe as a whole. There is no need, therefore, to regard the observer as basically separate from what he sees, nor to reduce him to an epiphenomenon of the objective process. Indeed the notion of separateness is an abstraction and an approximation valid for only certain limited purposes. More broadly one could say that through the human being, the universe is making a mirror to observe itself. Or vice versa the universe could be regarded as continuous with the body of the human being. After all, this latter, like the plant, gets all its substance and energy from the universe and eventually falls back into it. Evidently the human being could not exist without this context (which has very misleadingly been called an environment).
>
>Although the implicate order is a theory of the whole, it is in no sense a ‘theory of everything’. Or to put it differently we do not expect any ‘mirror’ to provide a complete and perfect reflection of reality as a whole. Every mirror abstracts only some features of the world and reflects them only to a limited degree of accuracy as well as from a limited perspective. We emphasise again that physical theories share in this sort of limit as much as all other forms of knowledge. For out thought is always a limited abstraction from the indefinitely great subtlety of the implicate order as a whole. We can always extend it, but then it will always still be limited. And beyond these limits, there is always indefinitely more that has not been grasped in thought.
>
>At the very least, the above is what would be implied by our proposal of an order of every increasing orders of subtlety in the implicate order. But probably the whole scheme of the implicate order will be found to be limited too, and will eventually have to be contained in some yet more comprehensive idea. More generally, we are not asserting finality for any of the ideas that we propose here. All proposals are points of departure for exploration. Eventually some of them may be developed so far that we may take them as working hypotheses. But in principle we will be ready to modify them or even to drop them whenever we find evidence for doing this. This applied even to the very idea that we are discussing at this moment. We suggest that the approach outlined above is more coherent than one in which we either tacitly or explicitly take specified features of our ideas as finally fixed and absolutely true.
>
>In particular we would say here that certain features of theories that have attempted to cover both mind and matter, for example, those proposed by Everett and by Gell-Mann and Hartle, do imply that mind is a rather limited sort of system (that could be completely covered for example by the notion of an ‘information gathering and utilizing system’ (IGUS)). No doubt mind is capable of doing this sort of thing. But a little observation shows it is much richer in its capabilities. In particular, if a human being is nothing more than such a system he is effectively reduced to a kind of machine. How then would we understand creativity? Perhaps we could say it is an illusion brought about by our not having complete knowledge of how the machine works. But we can ask how can it be known that this is all that we are? Thus, in the time of Newton, people compared everything including living beings to a clockwork and at later times the brain and nervous system were compared to a telephone exchange. It is now being compared to a super computer. In each age people use the latest technological developments as models for the mind. Very probably in another century or so the whole notion of computers will be seen as rather limited and perhaps even as outmoded as nineteenth-century machines are now thought to be. Doubtless we will then have a still more intricate machine with which one could compare the mind if one chose to do so.
>
>This whole approach seems to be affected with irreducible contingency. There is really no necessity for it at all. We are therefore free, if we so choose, to explore the broader approach to mind and matter, and therefore to the whole of reality, that we have been discussing here and throughout the rest of the book.
