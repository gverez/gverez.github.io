### Light and life [p. 6]
*Address at the opening meeting of the International Congress on Light Therapy in Copenhagen, August 1932.*

>Any well-defined change of an atom is an individual process consisting in a complete transition of the atom from one of its so-called stationary states to another. Moreover, since just one light quantum is exchanged in a transition process by which light is emitted or absorbed by an atom, we are able by means of spectroscopic observations to measure directly the energy of each of these stationary states. The information thus derived has also been most instructively corroborated by the study of the energy exchanges which take place in atomic collisions and in chemical reactions. […]
>
>The causal mechanical coordination of experience can be accomplished only in cases where the action involved is large compared with the quantum and where, therefore, a subdivision of the phenomena is possible. If this condition is not fulfilled, the action of the measuring instruments on the object under investigation cannot be disregarded and will entail a mutual exclusion of the various kinds of information required for a complete mechanical description of the usual type. This apparent incompleteness of the mechanical analysis of atomic phenomena issues ultimately from the ignorance of the reaction of the object on the measuring instruments inherent in any measurement. Just as the general concept of relativity expresses the essential dependence of any phenomenon on the frame of reference used for its coordination in space and time, the notion of complementarity severs to symbolize the fundamental limitation, met with in atomic physics, of the objective existence of phenomena independent of the means of their observation. […]
>
>On the one hand, the wonderful features which are constantly revealed in physiological investigations and which differ so markedly from what is known of inorganic matter have lead biologists to the belief that no proper understanding of the essential aspects of life is possible in purely physical terms. On the other hand, the view known as vitalism can hardly be given an unambiguous expression by the assumption that a peculiar vital force, unknown to physics, governs all organic life. Indeed, I think we all agree with Newton that the ultimate basis of science is the expectation that nature will exhibit the same effects under the same conditions. If, therefore, we were able to push the analysis of the mechanism of living organisms as far as that of atomic phenomena, we should not expect to find any features foreign to inorganic matter. In this dilemma it must be kept in mind, however, that the conditions in biological and physical research are not directly comparable, since the necessity of keeping the object of investigation alive imposes a restriction on the former which finds no counterpart in the latter. Thus, we should doubtless kill an animal if we tried to carry the investigation of its organs so far that we could tell the part played by the single atoms in vital functions. In every experiment on living organisms there must remain some uncertainty as regards the physical conditions to which they are subjected, and the idea suggests itself that the minimal freedom we must allow the organism will be just large enough to permit it, so to say, to hide its ultimate secrets from us. On this view, the very existence of life must in biology be considered as an elementary fact, just as in atomic physics the existence of the quantum of action has to be taken as a basic fact that cannot be derived from ordinary mechanical physics. Indeed, the essential non-analyzability of atomic stability in mechanical terms presents a close analogy to the impossibility of a physical or chemical explanation of the peculiar functions characteristic of life.
>
>In tracing this analogy, however, we must remember that the problems present essentially different aspects in atomic physics and in biology. While in the former field we are primarily interested in the behaviour of matter in its simplest forms, the complexity of the material systems with which we are concerned in biology is of fundamental nature, since even the most primitive organisms contain large numbers of atoms. It is true that the wide field of application of ordinary mechanics, including our account of the measuring instruments used in atomic physics, rests just on the possibility of largely disregarding the complementarity of the description entailed by the quantum of action in cases where we are dealing with bodies containing a great number of atoms. Notwithstanding the essential importance of the atomistic features, it is typical of biological research, however, that we can never control the external conditions to which any separate atom is subjected to the extent possible in the fundamental experiments of atomic physics. In fact, we cannot even tell which particular atoms really belong to a living organism, since any vital function is accompanied by an exchange of material through which atoms are constantly taken up into and expelled from the organisation which constitutes the living being. Indeed, this exchange of matter extends to all parts of a living organism to a degree which prevents a sharp distinction on an atomic scale between those features of its mechanism which can be unambiguously accounted for on usual mechanics and those for which a regard of the quantum of action is decisive. This fundamental difference between physical and biological research implied that no well-defined limit can be drawn for the applicability of physical ideas to the problems of life which corresponds to the distinction between the field of causal mechanical description and proper quantum phenomena in atomic mechanics. This apparent limitation of the analogy in question is rooted in the very definitions of the words life and mechanics which are ultimately a matter of convenience. […]
>
>In discussing the applicability of purely physical ideas to living organisms we have, of course, treated life just as any other phenomenon of the material world. I need hardly emphasize, however, that this attitude, which is characteristic of biological research, involves no disregard of the psychological aspect of life. On the contrary, the recognition of the limitation of mechanical concepts in atomic physics would rather seem suited to conciliate the apparently contrasting viewpoints of physiology and psychology. Indeed, the necessity of considering the interaction between the measuring instruments and the object under investigation in atomic mechanics exhibits a close analogy to the peculiar difficulties in psychological analysis arising from the fact that the mental content is invariably altered when the attention is concentrated on any special feature of it. It will carry us too far from our subject to enlarge upon this analogy which offers an essential clarification of psycho-physical parallelism. However, I should like to emphasize that considerations of the kind here mentioned are entirely opposed to any attempt of seeking new possibilities for a spiritual influence on the behaviour of matter in the statistical description of atomic phenomena. For instance, it is impossible, from our standpoint, to attach an unambiguous meaning to the view sometimes expressed that the probability of the occurrence of certain atomic processes in the body might be under the direct influence of the will. In fact, according to the generalized interpretation of the psycho-physical parallelism, the freedom of the will is to be considered as a feature of conscious life which corresponds to functions of the organism that not only evade a causal mechanical description but resist even a physical analysis carried to the extent required for an unambiguous application of the statistical laws of atomic mechanics. Without entering into metaphysical speculations, I may perhaps add that an analysis of the very concept of explanation would, naturally, begin and end with a renunciation as to explaining our own conscious activity.

### Biology and atomic physics [p. 13]
*Address at the Physical and Biological Congress in memory of Luigi Galvani, Bologna, October 1937.*

>From the very dawn of science, atomic theory has indeed been at the focus of interest in connection with the efforts to attain a comprehensive view of the great variety of natural phenomena. Thus already Democritus, who with so deep intuition emphasized the necessity of atomism for any rational account of the ordinary properties of matter, attempted, as is well known, also to utilize atomistic ideas for the explanation of the peculiarities of organic life and even of human psychology. In view of the fantastic character of such extreme materialistic conceptions, it was a natural reaction when Aristotle, with his masterly comprehension of the knowledge of his time in physics as well as in biology, rejected atomic theory entirely and tried to provide a sufficiently broad frame for an account of the wealth of natural phenomena on the basis of essentially teleological ideas. The exaggeration of the Aristotelian doctrine, on its side, was, however, clearly brought to light by the gradual recognition of elementary laws of nature valid as well for inanimate bodies as for living organisms. […]
>
>A clue to the solution of this dilemma was, however, already provided by Planck’s discovery of the elementary quantum of action which was the outcome of a very different line of physical research. As it is well known, Planck was led to this fundamental discovery by his ingenious analysis of such features of the thermal equilibrium between matter and radiation which, according to the general principles of thermodynamics, should be entirely independent of any specific properties of matter, and accordingly of any special ideas on atomic constitution. The existence of the elementary quantum of action expresses, in fact, a new trait of individuality of physical processes which is quite foreign to the classical laws of mechanics and electromagnetism and limits their validity essentially to those phenomena which involve actions large compared to the value of a single quantum, as given by Planck’s new atomistic constant. This condition, though amply fulfilled in the phenomena of ordinary physical experience, does in no way hold for the behaviour of electrons in atoms, and it is indeed only the existence of the quantum of action which prevents the fusion of the electrons and the nucleus into a neutral massive corpuscle of practically infinitesimal extension. […]
>
>Notwithstanding the encouragement given to the pursuit of such inquiries by the great example of relativity theory which, just through the disclosure of unsuspected presuppositions for the unambiguous use of all physical concepts, opened new possibilities for the comprehension of apparently irreconcilable phenomena, we must realize that the situation met with in modern atomic theory is entirely unprecedented in the history of physical science. Indeed, the whole conceptual structure of classical physics, brought to so wonderful a unification and completion by Einstein’s work, rests on the assumption, well adapted to our daily experience of physical phenomena, that it is possible to discriminate between the behaviour of material objects and the question of their observation. For a parallel to the lesson of atomic theory regarding the limited applicability of such customary idealisations, we must in fact turn to quite other branches of science, such as psychology, or even to that kind of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like Buddha and Lao Tse have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence. Still, the recognition of an analogy in the purely logical character of the problems which present themselves in so widely separated fields of human interest does in no way imply acceptance in atomic physics of any mysticism foreign to the true spirit of science, but on the contrary it gives us an incitation to examine whether the straightforward solution of the unexpected paradoxes met with in the application of our simplest concepts to atomic phenomena might not help us to clarify conceptual difficulties in other domains of experience.
>
>There has also been no lack of suggestions to look for a direct correlation between life or free will and those features of atomic phenomena for the comprehension of which the frame of classical physics is obviously too narrow. In fact, it is possible to point out many characteristic features of the reactions of living organisms, like the sensitivity of visual perception or the induction of gene mutation by penetrating radiation, which undoubtedly involve an amplification of the effects of individual atomic processes, similar to that on which the experimental technique of atomic physics is essentially based. Still, the recognition that the fineness of organization and regulation mechanisms of living beings goes even so far beyond any previous expectation does in itself in no way enable us to account for the peculiar characteristics of life. Indeed, the so-called holistic and finalistic aspects of biological phenomena can certainly not be immediately explained by the feature of individuality of atomic processes disclosed by the discovery of the quantum of action; rather would the essentially statistical character of quantum mechanics at first sight seem even to increase the difficulties of understanding the proper biological regularities. In this dilemma, however, the general lesson of atomic theory suggests that the only way to reconcile the laws of physics with the concepts suited for a description of the phenomena of life is to examine the essential difference in the conditions of the observation of physical and biological phenomena.
>
>First of all we must realize that every experimental arrangement with which we could study the behaviour of the atoms constituting an organism to the extent to which this can be done for single atoms in the fundamental experiments of atomic physics will exclude the possibility of maintaining the organism alive. The incessant exchange of matter which is inseparably connected with life will even imply the impossibility of regarding an organism as a well-defined system of material particles like the systems considered in any account of the ordinary physical and chemical properties of matter. In fact, we are led to conceive the proper biological regularities as representing laws of nature complementary to those appropriate to the account of the properties of inanimate bodies, in analogy with the complementary relationship between the stability properties of the atoms themselves and such behaviour of their constituent particles as allows of a description in terms of space-time coordination. In this sense, the existence of life itself should be considered, both as regards its definition and observation, as a basic postulate of biology, not susceptible of further analysis, in the same way as the existence of the quantum of action, together with the ultimate atomicity of matter, forms the elementary basis of atomic physics.
>
>It will be seen that such a viewpoint is equally removed from the extreme doctrines of mechanism and vitalism. On the one hand, it condemns as irrelevant any comparison of living organisms with machines, be these the relatively simple constructions contemplated by the old iatro-physicists, or the most refined modern amplifier devices, the uncritical emphasis of which would expose us to deserve the nickname of “iatro-quantists.” On the other hand, it rejects as irrational all such attempts at introducing some kind of special biological laws inconsistent with well-established physical and chemical regularities, as have in our days been revived under the impression of the wonderful revelations of embryology regarding cell growth and division. In this connection it must be especially remembered that the possibility of avoiding any such inconsistency within the frame of complementarity is given by the very fact that no results of biological investigation can be unambiguously described otherwise than in terms of physics and chemistry, just as any account of experience even in atomic physics must ultimately rest on the use of the concepts indispensable for a conscious recording of sense impressions.
>
>The last remark brings us back into the realm of psychology, where the difficulties presented by the problems of definition and observation in scientific investigations have been clearly recognized long before such questions became acute in natural science. Indeed, the impossibility in psychical experience to distinguish between the phenomena themselves and their conscious perception clearly demands a renunciation of a simple causal description on the model of classical physics, and the very way in which words like “thoughts” and “feelings” are used to describe such experience reminds one most suggestively of the complementarity encountered in atomic physics. I shall not here enter into any further detail but only emphasize that it is just this impossibility of distinguishing, in introspection, sharply between subject and object which provides the necessary latitude for the manifestation of volition. To connect free will more directly with limitation of causality in atomic physics, as it is often suggested, is, however, entirely foreign to the tendency underlying the remarks here made about biological problems.

### Discussion with Einstein on epistemological problems in atomic physics [p. 34]
*Contribution to Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist. The Library of Living Philosophers, vol. 7, 1949.*

>The failure of the theories of classical physics in accounting for atomic phenomena was further accentuated by the progress of our knowledge of the structure of atoms. Above all, Rutherford’s discovery of the atomic nucleus (1911) revealed at once the inadequacy of classical mechanical and electromagnetic concepts to explain the inherent stability of the atom. Here gain the quantum theory offered a clue for the elucidation of the situation and especially it was found possible to account for the atomic stability, as well as for the empirical laws governing the spectra of the elements, by assuming that any reaction of the atom resulting in a change of its energy involved a complete transition between two so-called stationary quantum states and that, in particular, the spectra were emitted by a step-like process in which each transition is accompanied by the emission of a monochromatic light quantum of an energy just equal to that of an Einstein photon.
>
>These ideas, which were soon confirmed by the experiments of Franck and Hertz (1914) on the excitation of spectra by impact of electrons on atoms, involved a further renunciation of the causal mode of description, since evidently the interpretation of the spectral laws implied that an atom in an excited state in general will have the possibility of transitions with photon emission to one or another of its lower energy states. In fact, the very idea of stationary states is incompatible with any directive for the choice between such transitions and leaves room only for the notion of the relative probabilities of the individual transition processes. The only guide in estimating such probabilities was the so-called correspondence principle which originated in the search for the closest possible connection between the statistical account of atomic processes and the consequences to be expected from classical theory, which should be valid in the limit where the actions involved in all stages of the analysis of the phenomena are large compared with the universal quantum. […]
>
>Important progress in the development of quantum theory was made by Einstein himself in his famous article on radiative equilibrium in 1917, where he showed that Planck’s law for thermal radiation could be simply deduced from assumptions conforming with the basic ideas of the quantum theory of atomic constitution. To this purpose, Einstein formulated general statistical rules regarding the occurrence of radiative transitions between stationary states, assuming not only that, when the atom is exposed to a radiation field, absorption as well as emission processes will occur with a probability per unit time proportional to the intensity of the irradiation, but that even in the absence of external disturbances spontaneous emission processes will take place with a rate corresponding to a certain a priori probability. […]
>
>In connection with a thorough examination of the exigencies of thermodynamics as regards radiation problems, Einstein stressed the dilemma still further by pointing out that the argumentation implied that any radiation process was “unidirected” in the sense that not only is a momentum corresponding to a photon with the direction of propagation transferred to an atom in the absorption process, but that also the emitting atom will receive an equivalent impulse in the opposite direction, although there can on the wave picture be no equation of a preference for a single direction in an emission process. Einstein’s own attitude to such startling conclusions is expressed in a passage at the end of the article, which may be translated as follows:
>
>>“These features of the elementary processes would seem to make the development of a proper quantum treatment of radiation almost unavoidable. The weakness of the theory lies in the fact that, on the one hand, no closer connection with the wave concepts is obtainable and that, on the other hand, it leaves to chance (Zufall) the time and the direction of the elementary processes; nevertheless, I have full confidence in the reliability of the way entered upon.”
>
>When I had the great experience of meeting Einstein for the first time during a visit to Berlin in 1920, these fundamental questions formed the theme of our conversations. The discussions, to which I have often reverted in my thoughts, added to all my admiration for Einstein a deep impression of his detached attitude. Certainly, his favoured use of such picturesque phrases as “ghost waves (Gespensterfelder) guiding the photons” implied no tendency to mysticism, but illuminated rather a profound humour behind his piercing remarks. Yet, a certain difference in attitude and outlook remained, since, with his mastery for co-ordinating apparently contrasting experience without abandoning continuity and causality, Einstein was perhaps more reluctant to renounce such ideals than someone for whom renunciation in this respect appeared to be the only way open to proceed with the immediate task of co-ordinating the multifarious evidence regarding atomic phenomena, which accumulated from day to day in the exploration of this new field of knowledge. […]
>
>This crucial point, which was to become a main theme of the discussions reported in the following, implied the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the typical quantum effects finds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt of subdividing the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental arrangement introducing new possibilities of interaction between objects and measuring instruments which in principle cannot be controlled. Consequently, comprehended within a single picture, but must be regarded as complementary in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhausts the possible information about the objects. […]
>
>Thus, a sentence like “we cannot know both the momentum and the position of an atomic object” raises at once questions as to the physical reality of two such attributes of the object, which can be answered only by referring to the conditions for the unambiguous use of space-time concepts, on the one hand, and dynamical conservation laws, on the other hand. While the combination of these concepts into a single picture of a causal chain of events is the essence of classical mechanics, room for regularities beyond the grasp of such a description is just afforded by the circumstance that the study of the complementary phenomena demands mutually exclusive experimental arrangements. […]
>
>Notwithstanding all novelty of approach, causal description is upheld in relativity theory within any given frame of reference, but in quantum theory the uncontrollable interaction between the objects and the measuring instruments forces us to a renunciation even in such respect. This recognition, however, in no way points to any limitation of the scope of the quantum-mechanical description, and the trend of the whole argumentation presented in the Como lecture was to show that the viewpoint of complementarity may be regarded as a rational generalization of the very ideal of causality.
>
>At the general discussion in Como, we all missed the presence of Einstein, but soon after, in October 1927, I had the opportunity to meet him in Brussels at the Fifth Physical Conference of the Solvay Institute, which was devoted to the theme “Electrons and Photons”. […] During the discussions, where the whole subject was reviewed by contributions from many sides and where also the arguments mentioned in the preceding pages were again presented, Einstein expressed, however, a deep concern over the extent to which causal account in space and time was abandoned in quantum mechanics. […]
>
>Our talks about the attitude to be taken in face of a novel situation as regards analysis and synthesis of experience touched naturally on many aspects of philosophical thinking, but, in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions. On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing (“… ob der liebe Gott würfelt”), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language. I remember also how at the peak of the discussion Ehrenfest, in his affectionate manner of teasing his friends, jokingly hinted at the apparent similarity between Einstein’s attitude and that of the opponents of relativity theory; but instantly Ehrenfest added that he would not be able to find relied in his own mind before concord with Einstein was reached. […]
>
>Thus, after referring to the conclusions derived by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen on the basis of their criterion, I wrote:
>
>>“Such an argumentation, however, would hardly seem suited to affect the soundness of quantum-mechanical description, which is based on a coherent mathematical formalism covering automatically any procedure of measurement like that indicated. The apparent contradiction in fact discloses only an essential inadequacy of the customary viewpoint of natural philosophy for a rational account of physical phenomena of the type with which we are concerned in quantum mechanics. Indeed the finite interaction between object and measuring agencies conditioned by the very existence of the quantum of action entails – because of the impossibility of controlling the reaction of the object on the measuring instruments, if these are to serve their purpose – the necessity of a final renunciation of the classical ideal of causality and a radical revision of our attitude towards the problem of physical reality. In fact, as we shall see, a criterion of reality like that proposed by the named authors contains – however cautious its formulation may appear – an essential ambiguity when it is applied to the actual problems with which we are here concerned.” […]
>
>The argumentation of the article was summarized in the following passage:
>
>>“From out point of view we now see that the wording of the above-mentioned criterion of physical reality proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen contains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of the expression “without in any way disturbing a system.” Of course there is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation during the last critical stage of the measuring procedure. But even at this stage there is essentially the question of an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behaviour of the system. Since these conditions constitute an inherent element of the description of any phenomenon to which the term “physical reality” can be properly attached, we see that the argumentation of the mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that quantum-mechanical description is essentially incomplete. On the contrary, this description, as appears from the preceding discussion, may be characterized as a rational utilization of all possibilities of unambiguous interpretation of measurements, compatible with the finite and uncontrollable interaction between the objects and the measuring instruments in the field of quantum theory. In fact, it is only the mutual exclusion of any two experimental procedures, permitting the unambiguous definition of complementary physical quantities, which provides room for new physical laws, the coexistence of which might at first sight appear irreconcilable with the basic principles of science. It is just this entirely new situation as regards the description of physical phenomena that the notion of complementarity aims at characterizing.” […]
>
>Einstein’s own view at that time are presented in an article “Physics and Reality,” published in 1936 in the Journal of the Franklin Institute. Starting from a most illuminating exposition of the gradual development of the fundamental principles in the theories of classical physics and their relation to the problem of physical reality, Einstein here argues that the quantum-mechanical description is to be considered merely as a means of accounting for the average behaviour of a large number of atomic systems, and his attitude to the belief that it should offer an exhaustive description of the individual phenomena is expressed in the following words: “To believe this is logically possible without contradiction; but it is so very contrary to my scientific instinct that I cannot forego the search for a more complete conception.” […]
>
>Besides the complementary features conspicuous in psychology and already touched upon, examples of such relationships can also be traced in biology, especially as regards the comparison between mechanistic and vitalistic viewpoints. Just with respect to the observational problem, this last question had previously been the subject of an address to the International Congress on Light Therapy held in Copenhagen in 1932, where it was incidentally pointed out that even the psycho-physical parallelism as envisaged by Leibniz and Spinoza has obtained a wider scope through the development of atomic physics, which forces us to an attitude towards the problem of explanation recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.
>
>Utterances of this kind would naturally in many minds evoke the impression of an underlying mysticism foreign to the spirit of science; at the above-mentioned Congress in 1936 I therefore tried to clear up such misunderstandings and to explain that the only question was an endeavour to clarify the conditions, in each field of knowledge, for the analysis and synthesis of experience. Yet, I am afraid that I had in this respect only little success in convincing my listeners, for whom the dissent among the physicists themselves was naturally a cause of scepticism about the necessity of going so far in renouncing customary demands as regards the explanation of natural phenomena. Not least through a new discussion with Einstein in Princeton in 1937, where we did not get beyond a humourous contest concerning which side Spinoza would have taken if he had lived to see the development of our days, I was strongly reminded of the importance of utmost caution in all questions of terminology and dialectics.
>
>These aspects of the situation were especially discussed at a meeting in Warsaw in 1938, arranged by the International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations. The preceding years had seen great progress in quantum physics owing to a number of fundamental discoveries regarding the constitution and properties of atomic nuclei as well as important developments of the mathematical formalism taking the requirements of relativity theory into account. In the last respect, Dirac’s ingenious quantum theory of the electron offered a most striking illustration of the power and fertility of the general quantum-mechanical way of description. In the phenomena of creation and annihilation of electron pairs we have in fact to do with new fundamental features of atomicity, which are intimately connected with the non-classical aspects of quantum statistics expressed in the exclusion principle, and which have demanded a still more far-reaching renunciation of explanation in terms of a pictorial representation.
>
Meanwhile, the discussion of the epistemological problems in atomic physics attracted as much attention as ever and, in commenting on Einstein’s views as regards the incompleteness of the quantum-mechanical mode of description, I entered more directly on questions of terminology. In this connection I warned especially against phrases, often found in the physical literature, such as “disturbing of phenomena by observation” or “creating physical attributes to atomic objects by measurements.” Such phrases, which may serve to remind of the apparent paradoxes in quantum theory, are at the same time apt to cause confusion, since words like “phenomena” and “observations,” just as “attributes” and “measurements,” are used in a way hardly compatible with common language and practical definition. […]
>
>Thus, the smallness of the quantum of action compared with the actions involved in usual experience, including the arranging and handling of physical apparatus, is as essential in atomic physics as is the enormous number of atoms composing the world in the general theory of relativity which, as is often pointed out, demands that dimensions of apparatus for measuring angles can be made small compared with the radius of curvature of space.

### Unity of knowledge [p. 73]
*Address delivered at a conference in October 1954 in connection with the Bicentennial of Columbia University, New York.*

>The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangements for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude. The circumstance that, in general, one and the same experimental arrangement may yield different recordings is sometimes picturesquely described as a “choice of nature” between such possibilities. Needless to say, such a phrase implies no allusion to a personification of nature, but simply points to the impossibility of ascertaining on accustomed lines directives for the course of a closed indivisible phenomenon. Here, logical approach cannot go beyond the deduction of the relative probabilities for the appearance of the individual phenomena under given experimental conditions. In this respect, quantum mechanics presents a consistent generalization of deterministic mechanical description which it embraces as an asymptotic limit in the case of physical phenomena on a scale sufficiently large to allow the neglect of the quantum of action. […]
>
>In the last decades, great advances have been achieved in our knowledge of the structure and functioning of organisms, and in particular it has become evident that quantum regularities in many respects here play a fundamental role. Not only are such regularities basic of the remarkable stability of the highly complex molecular structures which form the essential constituents of the cells responsible for the hereditary properties of the species, but research on mutations produced by exposing organisms to penetrating radiation offers a striking application of the statistical laws of quantum physics. Also, the sensitivity of perceptive organs, so important for the integrity of the organisms, has been found to approach the level of individual quantum processes, and amplification mechanisms play an important part especially in the transmission of nervous messages. […]
>
>Returning to the general epistemological lesson which atomic physics has given us, we must in the first place realize that the closed processes studied in quantum physics are not directly analogous to biological functions for the maintenance of which a continual exchange of matter and energy between the organism and the environments is required. Moreover, any experimental arrangement which would permit control of such functions to the extent demanded for their well-defined description in physical termed would be prohibitive to the free display of life. This very circumstance, however, suggests an attitude to the problem of organic life providing a more appropriate balance between a mechanistic and a finalist approach. In face, just as the quantum of action appears in the account of atomic phenomena as an element for which an explanation is neither possible nor required, the notion of life is elementary in biological science where, in the existence and evolution of living organisms, we are concerned with manifestations of possibilities in that nature to which we belong rather than with the outcome of experiments which we can ourselves perform. Actually, we must recognize that the requirements of objective description, in tendency at least, are fulfilled by the characteristic complementary way in which arguments based on the full resources of physical and chemical science, and concepts directly referring to the integrity of the organism transcending the scope of these sciences, are practically used in biological research. The main point is that only by renouncing an explanation of life in the ordinary sense do we gain a possibility of taking into account its characteristics. […]
>
>An especially striking example is offered by the relationship between situations in which we ponder on the motives for our actions and in which we experience a feeling of volition. In normal life, such shifting of the separation is more or less intuitively recognized, but symptoms characterized as “confusion of the egos,” which may lead to dissolution of the personality, are well known in psychiatry. The use of apparently contrasting attributes referring to equally important aspects of the human mind presents indeed a remarkable analogy to the situation in atomic physics, where complementary phenomena for their definition demand different elementary concepts. Above all, the circumstance that the very word “conscious” refers to experiences capable of being retained in the memory suggests a comparison between conscious experiences and physical observations. In such an analogy, the impossibility of providing an unambiguous content to the idea of subconsciousness corresponds to the impossibility of pictorial interpretation of the quantum-mechanical formalism. Incidentally, psychoanalytical treatment of neuroses may be said to restore balance in the content of the memory of the patient by bringing him new conscious experience, rather than by helping him to fathom the abysses of his subconsciousness.
>
>From a biological point of view, we can only interpret the characteristics of psychical phenomena by concluding that every conscious experience corresponds to a residual impression in the organism, amounting to an irreversible recording in the nervous system of the outcome of processes which are not open to introspection and hardly adapted to exhaustive definition by mechanistic approach. Certainly, such recordings in which the interplay of numerous nerve cells is involved are essentially different from the permanent structures in any single cells of the organism which are connected with genetic reproduction. From a finalistic point of view, however, we may stress not only the usefulness of permanent recordings in their influence on our reactions to subsequent stimuli, but equally the importance that later generations are not encumbered by the actual experiences of individuals by rely only on the reproduction of such properties of the organism as have proved serviceable for the collection and utilization of knowledge. In any attempt to pursue the enquiry we must, of course, be prepared to meet increasing difficulties at every step, and it is suggestive that the simple concepts of physical science lose their immediate applicability to an every higher degree the more we approach the features of living organisms related to the characteristics of our mind.
>
>To illustrate the argument, we may briefly refer to the old problem of free will. From what has already been said it is evident that the word volition is indispensable to an exhaustive description of psychical phenomena, but the problem is how far we can speak about freedom to act according to our possibilities. As long as unrestricted deterministic views are taken, the idea of such freedom is of course excluded. However, the general lesson of atomic physics, and in particular of the limited scope of mechanistic description of biological phenomena, suggests that the ability of organisms to adjust themselves to environment includes the power of selecting the most appropriate way to this purpose. Because it is impossible to judge such questions on a purely physical basis, it is most important to recognize that psychological experience may offer more pertinent information on the problems. The decisive point is that, if we attempt to predict what another person will decide to do in a given situation, not only must we strive to know his whole background, including the story of his life in all respects which may have contributed to form his character, but we must realize that what we are ultimately aiming at is to put ourselves in his place. Of course, it is impossible to say whether a person wants to do something because he believes he can, or whether he can because he will, but it is hardly disputable that we have the feeling of, so-to-speak, being able to make the best out of the circumstance. From the point of view of objective description, nothing can here be added or taken away, and in this sense we may both practically and logically speak of freedom of will in a way which leaves the proper latitude for the use of words like responsibility and hope, which themselves are as little definable separately as other words indispensable to human communication.

>Such considerations point to the epistemological implications of the lesson regarding our observational position, which the development of physical science has impressed upon us. In return for the renunciation of accustomed demands on explanation, it offers a logical means of comprehending wider fields of experience, necessitating proper attention to the placing of the object-subject separation. Since, in philosophical literature, reference is sometimes made to different levels of objectivity or subjectivity or even of reality, it may be stressed that the notion of an ultimate subject as well as conceptions like realism and idealism find no place in objective description as we have defined it; but this circumstance of course does not imply any limitation of the scope of the enquiry with which we are concerned.

>We are here at a point where the question of unity of knowledge evidently contains ambiguity, like the word “truth” itself. Indeed, with respect to spiritual and cultural values we are also reminded of epistemological problems related to the proper balance between our desire for an all-embracing way of looking at life in its multifarious aspects and our power of expressing ourselves in a logically consistent manner. […]

>In emphasizing the necessity in unambiguous communication of paying proper attention to the placing of the object-subject separation, modern development of science has, however, created a new basis for the use of such words as knowledge and belief. Above all, the recognition of inherent limitations in the notion of causality has offered a frame in which the idea of universal predestination is replaced by the concept of natural evolution. […] Still, though the closest possible combination of justice and charity presents a common goal in all cultures, it must be recognized that any occasion which calls for the strict application of law has no room for the display of charity and that, conversely, benevolence ad compassion may conflict with all ideas of justice. This point, in many religions mythically illustrated by the fight between deities personifying such ideals, is stressed in old Oriental philosophy in the admonition never to forget as we search for the harmony in human life that on the scene of existence we are ourselves actors as well as spectators.

### Atoms and human knowledge [p. 91]
*Address delivered at a meeting of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences in Copenhagen, October 1955.*

>The epistemological lesson of atomic physics has naturally, just as have earlier advances in physical science, given rise to renewed consideration of the use of our means of communication for objective description in other fields of knowledge. Not least the emphasis placed on the observational problem raises the question of the position of living organisms in the description of nature and of our own extent, possible within the frame of classical physics to compare organisms with machines, it was clear that such comparisons did not take sufficient account of many of the characteristics of life. The inadequacy of the mechanical concept of nature for the description of man’s situation is particularly evident in the difficulties entailed in the primitive distinction between soul and body. […]

>Without attempting any exhaustive definition of organic life, we may say that a living organism is characterized by its integrity and adaptability, which implies that a description of the internal functions of an organism and its reaction to external stimuli often requires the word purposeful, which is foreign to physics and chemistry. Although the results of atomic physics have found a multitude of applications in biophysics and biochemistry, the closed individual quantum phenomena exhibit, of course, no feature suggesting the notion of life. As we have seen, the description of atomic phenomena, exhaustive within a wide domain of experience, is based on the free use of such measuring instruments as are necessary to proper application of the elementary concepts. In a living organism, however, such a distinction between the measuring instruments and the objects under investigation can hardly be fully carried through, and we must be prepared that every experimental arrangement whose aim is a description of the functioning of the organism, which is well defined in the sense of atomic physics, will be incompatible with the display of life.
>
>In biological research, references to features of wholeness and purposeful reactions of organisms are used together with the increasingly detailed information on structure and regulatory processes that has resulted in such great progress not least in medicine. We have here to do with a practical approach to a filed where the means of expression used for the description of its various aspects refer to mutually exclusive conditions of observation. In this connection, it must be realized that the attitudes terms mechanistic and finalistic are not contradictory points of view, but rather exhibit a complementary relationship which is connected with our position as observers of nature. To avoid misunderstanding, however, it is essential to note that – in contrast to the account of atomic regularities – a description of organic life and an evaluation of its possibilities of development cannot aim at completeness, but only at sufficient width of the conception framework.
>
>In the account of psychical experiences, we meet conditions of observation and corresponding means of expression still further removed from the terminology of physics. Quite apart from the extent to which the use of words like instinct and reason in the description of animal behaviour is necessary and justifiable, the word consciousness, applied to oneself as well as to others, is indispensable when describing the human situation. While the terminology adapted to orientation in the environment could take as its starting point simple physical pictures and ideas of causality, the account of our states of mind required a typical complementary mode of description. Indeed, the use of words like thought and feeling does not refer to a firmly connected causal chain, but to experiences which exclude each other because of different distinctions between the conscious content and the background which we loosely term ourselves.
>
>The relation between the experience of a feeling of volition and conscious pondering on motives for action is especially instructive. The indispensability of such apparently contrasting means of expression to the description of the richness of conscious life strikingly reminds us of the way in which elementary physical concepts are used in atomic physics. In such a comparison, however, we must recognize that psychical experience cannot be subjected to physical measurements and that the very concept of volition does not refer to a generalization of a deterministic description, but from the outset points to characteristics of human life. Without entering into the old philosophical discussion of freedom of the will, I shall only mention that in an objective description of our situation use of the word volition corresponds closely to that of words like hope and responsibility, which are equally indispensable to human communication.

>In this so-called classical mechanics all reference to purpose is eliminated, since the course of events is described as automatic consequences of given initial conditions. […]

>On the philosophical side, it was especially Descartes who stressed the similarity between animals and automata, but ascribed to human beings a soul interacting with the body in a certain gland in the brain. […]

>Subsequent developments in biology, especially after the invention of the microscope, revealed an unsuspected fineness in organic structure and regulatory processes. At the same time that mechanistic ideas thus found ever wider applications, so-called vitalistic or finalistic points of view, inspired by the wonderful power of regeneration and adaptation in organisms, were repeatedly expressed. Rather than returning to primitive ideas of a life force acting in the organisms, such views emphasized the insufficiency of physical approach in accounting for the characteristics of life. […]

>In order to present the situation in physics as clearly as possible, I shall start by reminding you of the extreme attitude which, under the impact of the great success of classical mechanics, was expressed in Laplace’s well-known conception of a world machine. All interactions between the constituents of this machine were governed by the laws of mechanics, and therefore an intelligence knowing the relative positions and velocities of these parts at a given moment could predict all the subsequent events in the world, including the behaviour of animals and man. In this whole conception which has, as is well known, played an important role in philosophical discussion, due attention is not paid to the presuppositions for the applicability of the concepts indispensable for communication of experience.

>Progress in the field of atomic physics has, as is well known, found wide application in the biological sciences. In particular, I may mention the understanding we have gained of the peculiar stability of chemical structures in the cells responsible for the hereditary properties of the species, and of the statistical laws for the occurrence of mutations produced by exposing organisms to special agencies. Furthermore, amplification effects similar to those permitting observation of individual atomic particles play a decisive role in many functions of the organism. In this way is stressed the irreversible character of typical biological phenomena, and the time direction inherent in the description of the functioning of organisms is strikingly marked by their utilization of past experience for reactions to future stimuli.
>
>In this promising development we have to do with a very important and, according to its character, hardly limited extension of the application of purely physical and chemical ideas to biological problems, and since quantum mechanics appears as a rational generalization of classical physics, the whole approach may be termed mechanistic. The question, however, is in what sense such progress has removed the foundation for the application of so-called finalistic arguments in biology. Here we must realize that the description and comprehension of the closed quantum phenomena exhibit no feature indicating that an organization of atoms is able to adapt itself to the surroundings in the way we witness in the maintenance and evolution of living organisms. Furthermore, it must be stressed that an account, exhaustive in the sense of quantum physics, of all the continually exchanged atoms in the organism not only is infeasible but would obviously require observational conditions incompatible with the display of life. […]

>Apart from all differences with respect to observational conditions, communication of biological experiences contains no more reference to the subjective observer than does the description of physical evidence. Thus, so far it has not been necessary to enter more closely into the conditions of observation characteristic for the account of psychological phenomena, for which we cannot rely on the conceptual frame developed for our orientation in inanimate nature. However, the fact that conscious experience can be remembered and therefore must be supposed to be connected with permanent changes in the constitution of the organism points to a comparison between psychical experiences and physical observations. With respect to relationships between conscious experiences we also encounter features reminiscent of the conditions for the comprehension of atomic phenomena. The rich vocabulary used in the communications of the states of our mind refers indeed to a typical complementary mode of description corresponding to a continual change of the content on which attention is focused.
>
>Compared to the extension of the mechanical mode of description demanded by the account of the individuality of atomic phenomena, the integrity of the organism and the unity of the personality confront us of course with a rather generalization of the frame for the rational use of our means of communication. In this respect, it must be emphasized that the distinction between subject and object, necessary for unambiguous description, is retained in the way that in every communication containing a reference to ourselves we, so-to-speak, introduce a new subject which does not appear as part of the content of the communication. It need hardly be stressed that it is just this freedom of choosing the subject-object distinction which provides room for the multifariousness of conscious phenomena and the richness of human life.
