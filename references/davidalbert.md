## Interpreting the many worlds interpretation <a name="interpreting"></a>
*With Barry Loewer, Synthese, vol. 77, no.2, pp. 195-213, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1988*

### The many worlds interpretation [p. 3]

>Here we want to discuss a response to the measurement problem called “the many-worlds” interpretation, first suggested by Everett and later developed by DeWitt, Wheeler, and others. The fundamental idea of the many worlds interpretation is that measurements, and indeed all physical processes, must take place in accordance with the Schrödinger equation (or one of its relativistic variants). On this view, the state at the conclusion of a measurement process such as was described above is, the uncollapsed state.
>
>Consequently, there is simply no need, within this interpretation, to find an “explanation” of the collapse. One of the attractions of the many worlds interpretation is that since it does not require a division between measured system and measuring apparatus it is in principle possible to characterize the entire universe at any given time by a state function, a “universal wave function”, the time evolution of which is governed by a Schrödinger equation. Thus the account has special appeal to cosmologists who may want to consider the quantum state of the universe. According to the orthodox interpretation every measurement presupposes a distinction between the system being measured (which is described quantum mechanically) and the measuring apparatus (which is described classically). On this account it is difficult to see how quantum theory can be applied to the whole universe. In contrast the many worlds interpretation allows one to speak of the quantum state of the entire universe and so seems more suited for cosmological applications. […]
>
>Although it may “solve” the measurement problem, the many-worlds interpretation faces difficulties of its own. The most obvious is that it is difficult to square its claim that […] the final, post measurement state is not an eigenstate but a superposition of such states. How can that be? That the pointer on a measuring device is at some particular position at the conclusion of a measurement is not, after all, a theoretical hypothesis which is open to question, but rather (or so it would seem), a straightforward empirical fact. When we look at the pointer (look to see the value of Q) it manifestly has a particular position. It is not clear what it would be to see a macroscopic observable in a superposition although some authors imagine that it is like seeing a blur. Moreover, when a human observer interacts with a system […], then the Schrödinger equation entails that she (her brain, that is) evolves into a superposition of belief states concerning the position of the pointer! But what can that mean? We certainly do not experience ourselves as in superpositions of belief states, or as evolving into them, when we make observations! […]
>
>In addition to making the claim that all physical processes are described by a Schrödinger equation, the many worlds interpretation is supposed to explain how that claim can be true while avoiding the problems just mentioned. It is just this which makes it an interpretation. We want to inquire here whether or not the interpretation can deal with these problems; but this task is complicated at the outset by the fact that it isn’t entirely clear just what the many-worlds interpretation is. In an illuminating article, Richard Healy remarked that “the interpretation itself needs interpreting”. We very much agree with him.



### The splitting worlds view [p. 5]

>So perhaps it will be best to start off by clearing up a certain confusion. There is a way of understanding the many worlds interpretation (a way one especially finds in the popular literature quantum theory) which, we will argue, is unsatisfactory. On interpretation, which we call “the splitting worlds view”, (SWV) when a quantum measurement occurs, the measuring device and indeed the whole literally splits into two or more (depending on the number possible outcomes of the measurement) worlds. Heinz Pagels (1984) seems to understand the many worlds interpretations as the SWV. Bryce DeWitt […] also understands the interpretation this way. However, Everett’s views are much more ambiguous, at times suggesting aspects of the view we later advance.
>
>The following passage by DeWitt suggests the SWV:
>
>>“The universe is constantly splitting into a stupendous number of branches, all resulting from the measurement like interactions between its myriads of components. Moreover, every quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies itself.”
>
>One way of understanding DeWitt’s remarks is as asserting that the components of the universal state function of the universe at a given time themselves each represent a world at that time. The time dependence of the universal state function is taken to characterize sequences of such worlds or world histories. If at t0 @ is such a world-component of the overall state-function, and if an interaction takes place within the world described by @, and if that interaction results in @1 and @2 being world-components at the completion of the interaction, then the SWV instructs us to conceive of the world corresponding to @ as having “split” into the two worlds, @1 and @2. The worlds of the SWV may remind one of the “possible worlds” which are discussed in philosophical logic. They differ at least in two respects. All the worlds of the SWV are equally real and none are abstract. In this it differs from the common view that possible worlds are abstract entities of some kind, sets of propositions or properties. It is more like David Lewis’ realism about possible worlds except that on the SWV worlds split. Second, their worlds of the SWV are “quantum” worlds in that some observables are in superpositions at a world.
>
>DeWitt says of this view:
>
>>“I still recall vividly the shock I experienced on first encountering this multiworld concept. The idea of 10100+ slightly imperfect copies of oneself all constantly splitting into further copies, which ultimately become unrecognizable, is not easy to reconcile with common sense.”
>
>DeWitt attempts to reconcile the SWV with common sense by arguing that “to the extent to which we can be regarded simply as automata and hence on a par with ordinary measuring apparatuses, the laws of quantum mechanics do not allow us to feel the splits.” […]
>
>Everett and DeWitt discovered, surprisingly, that even though the Schrödinger equation is inconsistent with collapses, it predicts that it will appear to observers (in the sense just explained) that collapses occur. On the SWV, splitting plays the role of a collapse by producing successors of measuring devices (including observers) which record unique values of measurements. It is this which leads one, and indeed led Everett in the first place, to think that there is something to the many worlds idea.
>
>There remains the problem of making sense of the probability interpretation of the amplitudes on the SWV. The problem is a formidable one because the dynamical equations are completely deterministic. So how does probability enter the picture? […] DeWitt seems to think that this identification solves the difficulty concerning probability and remarks that the argument shows that “the conventional probability interpretation of quantum mechanics thus emerges from the formalism itself.”
>
>There are many things wrong with the SWV. Our criticisms will advance us toward an interpretation which, we will argue, is a more satisfactory way of understanding Everett’s fundamental idea; that all physical processes are governed by the dynamical equations. The first problem is the least subtle but perhaps the most destructive to the SWV. It is that the SWV is actually inconsistent with the dynamical equations. For example, according to the Schrödinger equation the total mass-energy before and after the interaction are the same. […] But on the SWV a measurement literally results in an astronomical increase of the number of particles and of the total mass-energy. Of course it will be the case that this increase in the number of particles (or mass-energy) will go undetected by observers. But this in no way alleviates the main point that the splitting process is literally inconsistent with the dynamical equations and so cannot be taken as an interpretation in which all physical processes are described by them. No adequate many-worlds interpretation can countenance any such incompatibility with the dynamical equations.
>
>The second difficulty concerns the understanding of probability within the SWV. Whatever merits DeWitt’s argument for his claim that the probability interpretation emerges from the quantum mechanical formalism may have, it doesn’t address the really difficult problem that the dynamical equations are deterministic. DeWitt’s argument falls short of demonstrating that the probability interpretation emerges from the formalism. In order to secure a probability interpretation he must identify an amplitude converging on 0 and a probability converging on 0. This is a substantial assumption, and no part of the quantum mechanical formalism. Indeed, DeWitt’s argument, as he himself seems to recognize, is circular. At one point he suggests that “maverick worlds” (worlds with the “wrong” frequencies) are “simply absent for the grand superposition.” That is, not only is the amplitude (probability) of such worlds 0 but they are physically impossible. However, this suggestion in conflict with the guiding idea of the many worlds interpretation that the Schrödinger equation describes all physical processes, since according to it here will be elements of the overall superposition which correspond to maverick worlds. There is no escape from the fact that any sequence of measurements such as was described above will invariably produce maverick world histories. If probability is to be introduced into the picture, it must necessarily be by adding something to the interpretation. For example, we might say that some of the worlds into which (2) splits are more “actual” than others (or that one of the successors and not the other is really A). Then probability can be identified with the probability that the actual world will follow a particular branch (or that A will find himself in a particular world). The trouble with this suggestion is not only that it is mysterious (what distinguishes the more actual worlds from the less actual ones?), but also that it gives up the central feature of the SWV, that the state-function entirely exhausts what there is to be said about the physical world.


### The many minds view [p. 10]

>The fundamental idea of the many worlds interpretation is that all physical processes whatsoever are governed by the Schrödinger equation. […]
>
>As we saw, the main difficulty that must be overcome to implement the fundamental idea is that this idea entails that macroscopic measuring devices and indeed observers themselves can be in superpositions. What we want is an “interpretation” which explains how it is that we always “see” (mistakenly so, if the many worlds interpretation is correct) macroscopic objects as not being in superpositions and never experience ourselves as in superpositions. The heart of the problem is that the way we conceive of mental states, beliefs, memories, etc., it simply makes no sense to speak of such states or of a mind as being in a superposition. When we introspect following an x-spin measurement we never, as apparently predicted by the theory, find ourselves in a superposition of thinking that spin is up and thinking that spin is down. If introspection is to be trusted, and it seems part of our very concept of mental states that it is trustworthy at least to this extent, then we are never in such superpositions. […]
>
>This view, which we call the single mind view (SMV), solves some of the problems that confront the SWV. On the SMV the entire physical world is a thoroughly quantum mechanical system. […] Principle (IV) is satisfied by interpreting quantum mechanical probabilities as the probabilities that an observer (a mind) will have certain beliefs after making a measurement. The world does not split upon measurement; rather, the mind associated with a brain ends up being in the mental state associated with one of the brain states in the superposition of B states that describes her brain. The probability that the mind will end up in a particular state is completely determined by the physical state of the observer + system measured. Everett’s and DeWitt’s original argument to explain why systems appear to collapse on measurement is easily adapted by the SWV. […] Further measurements by the observer will result in “confirmation” since the brain states that are part of the overall state all perceive the same value. There is no worry about the fact that we never feel ourselves to be in or introspect superpositions since mental states are never in superpositions. […]
>
>Of course the startling feature of the SMV is its non-physicalism. On the SMV, all but one of the elements of a superposition represent, as it were, mindless brains; and which element represents a mind is not determined by the physical nature of the underlying brain state and cannot be deduced from the quantum state or from any physical experiment. […] The non-physicalism of the SMV seems especially pernicious. It entails that mental states do not even supervene on brain states (or physical states generally) since one cannot tell from the state of a brain what its single mind believes.
>
>Here is a way to remedy the situation. Suppose that every sentient physical system, every observer, has associated with it not a single mind but rather an infinite set of minds. (The reason for the set’s being infinite will soon be apparent.) We will call this the “many minds view” (MMV). We suppose that when an individual’s brain (or brain + environment) is in state B the individual is in a certain mental state M, i.e., has certain beliefs, intentions, memories, experiences, etc. This supposition is physicalistic in that it says that mental states are determined by or supervenient on a brain (or brain + environment) states. […]
>
>The individual minds, as on the SMV, are not quantum mechanical systems; they are never in superpositions. This is what is meant by saying that they are non-physical. The time evolution of each of the minds on the MMV, just as on the SMV, probabilistic. However, unlike the SMV, there are enough minds associated with the brain initially so that minds will end up associated with each of the elements of the final superposition. An infinity of minds is required since a measurement or a sequence of measurements may have an infinite number of outcomes. Furthermore, although the evolution of individual minds is probabilistic, the evolution of the sets of minds […] is deterministic since the evolution of the measurement process is deterministic and we can read off from the final state the proportions of the minds in various mental states. […]
>
>We have purchased supervenience of the mental on the physical at the cost of postulating an infinity of minds associated with each sentient being. No doubt this talk of infinitely many minds sounds crazy. Perhaps it will seem less so after we see what it does for the interpretation of quantum mechanics and how it compares with other interpretations.
>
>First, and most important, the MMV (unlike the SWV) is in accord with the fundamental idea of the many worlds interpretation – that the entire physical universe, and every physical system, is quantum mechanical. […] There is no need to postulate collapses or splits or any other non-quantum mechanical physical phenomena. And so there arises no conflict with conservation laws as we saw on the SWV.
>
>Second, the MMV entails that the time-evolution of the whole physical world is completely deterministic, and that the “global mental state” of every sentient physical being (that is: the distribution of mental states among the infinity of that being’s minds) is uniquely fixed by the physical state of that being. Unlike the abandoned SMV, the global mental state is unambiguously determined by its physical state and consequently the time-evolution of the global state is, likewise, deterministic.
>
>Third, the MMV is in accord with our very deep conviction that mental states never superpose; consequently it is in accordance with the claim that competent sentient beings can accurately report their mental states.
>
>Fourth, the MMV (unlike the SWV) entails that the choice of basis vectors in terms of which the state of the world is expressed has no physical significance. There is always but one physical world in but one quantum mechanical state on this account; and that state can be equally well written in terms of any complete set of basis vectors. As long as a brain is in a state which can be represented as a super position of B states it will have minds associated with it.
>
>Fifth, there is no special problem on the MMV of interpreting probability. Probabilities are completely objective although they do not refer to physical events but always to sequences of states of individual minds. […] Although probabilities do not emerge from the quantum mechanical formalism we can adapt DeWitt’s argument to show from our postulate connecting the proportion of minds with amplitudes that the probability that a mind will believe that it resides in a “maverick” world (i.e., has beliefs different from those in accord with quantum mechanical probabilities) converges to 0 (but “maverick minds” will still be present).
>
>Sixth, the account is realist in the sense that it entails that there is a uniquely correct state for the whole universe and in the sense that it does not suppose that the state of the universe in any way depends on a consciousness or on what observables an observer decides to measure. In this it contrasts markedly with some “idealist” interpretations which entail that consciousness, by bringing about a col lapse or in choosing to measure certain observables, in some mysterious way makes reality (perhaps different realities for different observers). This realism, however, does have the consequence that a mind’s beliefs about the state of a system after measurement are typically false. DeWitt’s argument falls short of demonstrating that the probability interpretation emerges from the formalism. In order to secure a probability interpretation he must identify an amplitude converging on 0 and a probability converging on 0. This is a substantial assumption, and no part of the quantum mechanical formalism. Indeed, DeWitt’s argument, as he himself seems to recognize, is circular. At one point he suggests that “maverick worlds" (worlds with the “wrong” frequencies) are “simply absent for the grand superposition.” That is, not only is the amplitude (probability) of such worlds 0 but they are physically impossible. However, this suggestion in conflict with the guiding idea of the many worlds interpretation that the Schrödinger equation describes all physical processes, since according to it here will be elements of the overall superposition which correspond to maverick worlds. There is no escape from the fact that any sequence of measurements such as was described above will invariably produce maverick world histories. […]
>
>Not only is the MMV a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics, it also provides an account in which all interactions are local. This is surprising because Bell’s theorem is widely thought to rule out realist, local interpretation of quantum mechanics. Hilary Putnam (1983) has put forward a view according to which quantum mechanical entities “are real... but they are relative to an observer.” […]
>
>The MMV denies Bell’s version of realism according to it the real state of the electron + observer after a measurement of spin on the system is still in a superposition. […]
>
>The preceding list seems to us sufficiently impressive to give the MMV a hearing in spite of its dualist commitments. In general it can be said that unlike other accounts it allows one to tell completely explicit and intelligible stories, without employing non-classical logics or mysterious collapses, about any quantum mechanical process, including measurement; stories which are entirely consistent […] and hence are locally realistic. At the same time the account preserves our ordinary (and perhaps a priori) conception of mental states as accessible to introspection. The same cannot be said for any other “interpretation”. Of course, what allows for all of this is what must be admitted to be an extravagant dualism. One may wonder whether it may be possible to get away with less dualist commitments.
>
>One assumption, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the dualism, is that there is a matter of fact concerning whether or not a mind associated with a brain at one time is the same mind as one associated with the brain at different time. This assumption violates the supervenience of the mental on the physical since the evolution of the physical state of the universe does not determine such identities. (On the other hand, as we previously saw, the proportion of minds in the various mental states associated with a brain at a given time does supervene on the physical state of the brain, or brain plus environment.) We could effect a partial retreat from this dualism by postulating that associated with a brain at any one time is a set of “momentary minds” while not postulating that there is a matter of fact that a mind (associated with a particular brain) at one moment is trans-temporal identical with a mind (associated with the same brain) at another moment. However, the cost of surrendering the “trans-temporal identity of minds” would seem to be that we can no longer make sense of statements like “the probability that I will observe spin up on measurement is p” since such statements seem to presuppose that it makes to talk of a single mind persisting through time. Perhaps, however, it could be argued (though we will not do so here) that the conception of a mind persisting through time is an illusion; one that results from the fact that “most” momentary minds will be associated with brain states which record a “personal” history and so it will seem to such a mind that it has existed as a persisting entity.
>
>Could we go further and eliminate all reference to minds? Such an eliminativism would entail a radically different way of talking about quantum theory and about ourselves. To do so would, since quantum theory is completely deterministic, give up any way of making sense of quantum mechanical probabilities. Further, on such an account there would be no mental states as we ordinarily understand them. There will still be states, the brain states B, which register information and so may resemble mental states, but these states will not be introspectible […]. Whether it might be possible for us to learn such a language, that is, to learn to describe the world entirely in quantum mechanical terms, is a question that we must leave for another occasion.




## Elementary quantum metaphysics <a name="elementary"></a>
*Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory: An Appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996*

### Introduction [p. 277]

>Once upon a time, the twentieth-century investigations of the behaviors of sub-atomic particles were thought to have established that there can be no such thing as an objective, observer-independent, scientifically realist, empirically adequate picture of the physical world.
>
>And it was part and parcel of thinking things like that, it was (you might even say) the essence of thinking things like that, that one looked at quantum-mechanical wave functions not as representing physical objects directly, but (say) as representing what observers know of such objects, or as representing imaginary ensembles of such objects, or as representing the probabilities of the outcomes of measurements on such objects, or some- thing like that.
>
>And it has consequently been essential to the project of digging one's way out of those sorts of confusions, it has been essential (that is) to the project of quantum-mechanical realism (in whatever particular form it takes – Bohm's theory, or modal theories, or Everettish theories, or theories of spontaneous localization), to learn to think of wave functions as physical objects in and of themselves.
>
>That wave functions have the ontological status of physical objects is often claimed as a recent scientific discovery, as something that follows (more particularly) from the work of Aharonov and Viadman (1993) on so-called “weak” measurements.
>
>But that can't be right. Aharonov and Viadman's very beautiful discoveries can (after all) perfectly well be accommodated within any anti-realist interpretation of quantum mechanics; and insofar as we are committed to realism, there was simply never anything other than physical objects that wave functions could have been.
>
>And of course the space those sorts of objects live in, and (therefore) the space we live in, the space in which any realistic understanding of quantum mechanics is necessarily going to depict the history of the world as playing itself out (if space is the right name for it – of which more later) is configuration-space. And whatever impression we have to the contrary (whatever impression we have, say, of living in a three-dimensional space, or in a four-dimensional space-time) is somehow flatly illusory.
>
>I learned all this (insofar as I can reconstruct it now) from a few casual remarks scattered here and there in various papers and private communications of John Bell. And it has seemed so straightforward and so ineluctable to me since then as not to merit any further discussion.
>
>But it turns out not to have seemed that way to everybody. It turns out (as a matter of fact) that this sort of talk still frequently manages to surprise people, even to appal them.
>
>Maybe there's a point, then, in writing it all down in some detail – just to see how it looks when we're done, and to give its critics something convenient to shoot at.



### Realities [p. 278]
>The sorts of physical objects that wave functions are, on this way of thinking, are (plainly) fields – which is to say that they are the sorts of objects whose states one specifies by specifying the values of some set of numbers at every point in the space where they live, the sorts of objects whose states one specifies (in this case) by specifying the values of two numbers (one of which is usually referred to as an amplitude, and the other as a phase) at every point in the universe's so-called configuration space.
>
>Or at any rate that's how things would work for a universe of elementary particles whose spins are all zero. In more realistic cases, we shall of course have to specify the values of some larger set of quantities at every point, but you get the idea.
>
>The values of the amplitude and the phase are thought of (as with all fields) as intrinsic properties of the points in the configuration space with which they are associated. And so (for example) the fact that the integral over the entirety of the configuration of the square of the amplitude of the universe's wave function is invariably equal to one is going to have to be thought of not as following analytically from the sorts of physical objects wave function are (which it certainly can not), but as a physical law, or perhaps as an initial condition.
>
>What physical role this object plays in the world, precisely, will depend on precisely how the measurement problem gets solved.
>
>On Bohm's theory, for example, the world will consist of exactly two physical objects. One of those is the universal wave function and the other is the universal particle.
>
>And the story of the world consists, in its entirety, of a continuous succession of changes of the shape of the former and a continuous succession of changes in the position of the latter.
>
>And the dynamical laws that govern all those changes – that is: the Schrödinger equation and the Bohmian guidance condition – are completely deterministic, and (in the high-dimensional space in which these objects live) completely local.
>
>The correspondence with our ordinary, three-dimensional, multi-particle language is trivial. Every particle invariably has a perfectly determinate position, and (more particularly) the x, y, and z co-ordinates of particle m are, respectively, the (3m-2)th, the (3m-1)th, and the (3m)th co- ordinates of the world-particle.
>
>On the GRW theory (or for that matter on any theory of collapse), the world will consist of exactly one physical object – the universal wave function. What happens, all that happens, is that that function changes its shape in accord with the theory's dynamical laws. And those changes are not entirely continuous, and the laws which govern them are not entirely deterministic,
>
>Note, however, that to say that the laws of the evolutions of wave functions are probabilistic (which is perfectly true, on theories like GRW), is not at all to say that those wave functions are somehow probabilities themselves, or that quantum mechanics somehow confronts us with a new and utterly mysterious modality of 'potentia' or 'possibilia' (which is gibberish). On any realistic understanding of quantum theory, wave functions are never anything more or less than perfectly actual, perfectly low-brow, field-configurations.
>
>and (even in the high-dimensional configuration space) not entirely local.
>
>The probability that some particular GRW collapse will multiply the value of the world's wave function, evaluated at some particular point in the world's configuration space, by some particular number, will depend (after all) on the wave function of the world throughout the entirety of that configuration space (and not just at the single point in question) at the instant just before the collapse occurs.
>
>The correspondence with the three-dimensional multi-particle language is a bit more complicated. Talking about particles, in the context of these sorts of theories, is a way of talking about the wave function's shape. In particular, locutions like “particle m is located in the (finite) region bounded by x1 and x2 and y1 and y2 and z1 and z2” mean nothing more or less than that the universal wave function is (at the moment in question) bunched up in such a way that almost the entirety of its squared amplitude is confined to the (infinite) region between the x1 and x2 values of the (3m-2)th coordinate, and between the y1 and y2 values of the (3m-1)th co-ordinate, and between the z1 and z2 values of the (3m)th co-ordinate.
>
>Note, by the way, that the above understanding of locutions like “particle m is located in the region bounded by x1 and x2 and y1 and y2 and z1 and z2” counts such locutions as ineluctably vague. And there is no point in denying that this comes as something of a surprise. And it is surely worth recalling, at this juncture, that the meanings of locutions like that are perfectly precise on Bohm's theory. But there's nothing enormously mysterious here either, and (more particularly) none of this represents any fundamental impediment to the project of describing the world exactly. The world invariably has a perfectly exact description, on these theories, in the language of the wave function; and particle-talk is inexact purely and simply because it amounts to an inexact description of that.



### Appearances [p. 279]
>Those, then, are the rules whereby the three-dimensional multiple-particle language of our everyday lives supervenes on the exact and complete and fundamental language of the world, which is the language of wave functions (and whatever else) in configuration space.
>
>But what is it about the world that can have suggested that everyday language to us – that false language, that mirage – in the first place?
>
>What it is (I think) is the world's Hamiltonian; what it is is that the world has the sort of potential-energy operator whose expectation-value gets big exactly when (on that three-dimensional language; but not on any two-dimensional language, and not on any one-dimensional language, and not on any five-dimensional language) the expectation values of the “distances between particles” gets small. [...]
>
>But appearances are patently going to be another matter. How any particular quantum-mechanical world appears to its inhabitants, or at any rate how it appears to them if they don't look too closely, is going to be part and parcel of all of the usual arguments that insofar as so-called ‘familiar macroscopic objects’ under so-called ‘familiar macroscopic circumstances’ are concerned, the predictions of classical mechanics and the predictions of quantum mechanics are going to correspond with one another. Part of what has always followed from arguments like that (although we have perhaps not been in the habit of thinking about them in these terms) is that quantum-mechanical worlds are going to appear (falsely!) to their inhabitants, if they don't look too closely, to have the same number of spatial dimensions as their classical counterparts do. [...]
>
>That's what (I think) I think. But now that it's all on the table, maybe there's a point in trying to put it a bit more diplomatically.
>
>There are (you might say) two ideas we're accustomed to having in mind when we think of ‘physical space’.
>
>There is, to begin with, the space of possible interactive distances, the space (if there is one) that one reads off of the formal Pythagorean relations among the individual terms in the world's Hamiltonian – irrespective of whether those terms are considered as classical variables or quantum- mechanical operators. [...]
>
>And then there's an altogether different idea (and an altogether more fundamental one, it seems to me; but let's not squabble about that for the moment) of an arena within which the dynamics does its work, a stage on which whatever theory we happen to be entertaining at the moment depicts the world as unfolding: a space (that is) in which a specification of the local conditions at every address at some particular time (but not at any proper subset of them) amounts to a complete specification of the physical situation of the world, on that theory, at that time.
>
>And it just so happens that in the context of classical physics those two spaces invariably coincide,
>
>It just so happens (that is) that insofar as classical-mechanical theories of the world are concerned (and this is perhaps a way of putting one's finger on what it is that's distinctive about such theories) whatever amounts to a space of possible interactive distances amounts to a stage-space too.
>
>And it just so happens that in the context of quantum physics they don’t.
>
>The geometries of the interactive-distance-spaces of quantum theories depend (by definition – and precisely as they do in the classical case) on those theories' Hamiltonians, but the geometries of their stage-spaces don't. The stage-space appropriate to a quantum theory can (alas) never be anything other than that theory's configuration-space.
>
>That things can appear otherwise, if one doesn't look too closely, is a peculiarity of the wave functions of macroscopic objects. What happens is that the wave function of the world (on theories like GRW) or the effective wave function of the world (on theories like Bohm's) tends to be approximately separable in the centers-of-masses of objects like that, that the wave function of the world, or its effective wave function, tends to be approximately of the sort that can in fact be represented in the theory's interactive-distance space. And what makes that happen, in the GRW case, is the collapse part of the dynamics; and what makes it happen in the Bohm case is the part that governs the interactions of such objects with their environments.
>
>And so the habit of thinking of the two of those spaces together, and of calling them by a single name, turns out to be one more of the things that we are apparently going to have to learn to give up.
