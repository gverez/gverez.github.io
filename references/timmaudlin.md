### Non-locality [p. 286]

>So any theory which predicts violations of Bell's inequality for events at spacelike separation must, in this sense, be non-local. And if there are reliable violations of Bell's inequality for events at spacelike separation, then any physically adequate theory must be non-local. This is the moral of Bell's work, though it has taken a remarkably long time for that moral to be widely recognized. Bell's work is not particularly about “hidden variables” theories, nor particularly about deterministic theories, nor particularly about “realistic” theories (whatever that might mean). The theorems apply to hidden variables theories and to deterministic theories and to realistic theories because they apply to all theories. But the bottom line is that locality (not hidden variables or determinism or realism) cannot be reconciled with reliable violations of the inequalities at spacelike separation.
>
>So far, we have only a conditional result: if the inequalities are violated for measurements at spacelike separation, then no local theory can be predictively adequate. And it seems a small step to discharge the condition. Do not the experiments of Aspect et al. demonstrate violations of the inequalities at spacelike separation? Not every interpretation of the quantum formalism entails this result. The many-minds theory of Albert and Loewer (1988), for example, holds that measurements only have determinate outcomes in individual minds (not in the purely physical apparatus), and that the inequalities are only violated for sets of measurements that are experienced by a single mind. Since the relevant statistics govern only experiences in particular minds there is no violation of the inequalities for events at spacelike separation. Of course, all of this requires a peculiarly radical reinterpretation of Aspect's laboratory reports: they do not record particular outcomes on apparatus separated by 12 meters, with the outcomes being recorded within 5 nanoseconds of one another. and so on. Rather, they “record” only the experience of some mind, which experience does not reflect any unique course of physical events in the laboratory.
>
>The story about lab reports on the many-minds view is really more complicated than this: the ink on pages of journals ends up in a superposition of different states which report different results: a particular “result”, though, is experienced in the mind(s) of each reader.
>
>Let us call any interpretation of the quantum formalism according to which there was a unique set of outcomes in Aspect's laboratory, which outcomes occurred at spacelike separation, a “standard” interpretation. In this sense, any collapse theory, such as the GRW theory, is standard. Even a theory which ties collapses to consciousness can be standard, so long as a conscious observer is stationed at each apparatus to cause the collapse and ensure a definite outcome. The Copenhagen interpretation is also surely standard, as it insists on the necessity of describing the macroscopic laboratory equipment in classical terms, and the classical terms include phrases like “Apparatus A, set at 30°, registered spin up etc….”. That is, the classical description of Aspect's experiment entails that Bell’s inequalities were violated by events at spacelike separation. Bohm's theory is obviously also, in this sense, standard. […]
>
>In sum: both non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics and non-relativistic collapse theories (e.g., GRW) incorporate ineliminable physical influences between arbitrarily distant events, and both require absolute simultaneity to formulate their dynamics. The question we must now face is how, or whether, one could produce versions of these theories which are compatible with Relativity.

### The relativistic constraint [p. 290]

>It is not uncommon to interpret the Theory of Relativity as forbidding something from going faster than light. Elsewhere (1994), I have examined four distinct possibilities: no superluminal matter or energy transport; no superluminal signals; no superluminal causal influences; no superluminal informational exchange. I have also argued that violations of Bell’s inequality for events at spacelike separation do not demand violations of the first two constraints and do demand violations of the second two. But none of these constraints really seems to express the fundamentals of Relativity. First, it is obvious that one could construct a manifestly non-Relativistic theory (an ether theory of electromagnetism, say, with a preferred rest frame) which still forbade anything of interest from travelling faster than light (e.g., Maxwell's electrodynamics). Further, one can construct explicitly Relativistic theories (i.e., explicitly Lorentz invariant theories) which violate every one of the four proposed constraints. Relativity is a theory of space-time structure, not a theory of the exact nature or dynamics of the fields or particles which inhabit space-time. So we ought to frame the Relativistic constraint directly in terms of space- time structure, rather than in terms of anything going faster or slower than anything else.

### Who’s afraid of absolute time? [p. 295]

>Although the foregoing considerations are filled with gaps, elisions and caveats, they do suggest that the most straightforward route to putting quantum theory into a relativistic space-time is to add something to the space-time, and hence, at least implicitly, to reject Relativity as the complete story. Indeed, given that this is the most obvious way to frame a Bohmian or collapse theory in a non-classical space-time, we ought to take it as a benchmark. What Bohm's theory and the collapse theories seem to need is something like the classical notion of absolute simultaneity: a fundamental physical relation between events at space-like separation. In effect, such a relation would induce a foliation of the space-time, a division of the space-time manifold into a stack of space-like hyperplanes. Putting a measure over those hyperplanes yields an absolute time-function in terms of which the Bohmian dynamics or the collapse dynamics can be framed. If there is some- thing objectionable about adding a foliation to space-time, we should consider carefully just how objectionable it is, since there is no point in doing something even more objectionable just to retain the relativistic account of space-time. If we are really willing to seriously consider the postulation of backwards causation, for example, then we ought to be convinced that the dislocations attending such an innovation are less severe than would be the addition of a foliation to space-time.
>
>What, then, would be so terrible about slicing up space-time to provide dynamics for Bohmian mechanics or for wave collapse? The most obvious objection is that the foliation could not be determined empirically. Were the Logical Positivists still with us, they might even Object that the proposed structure is metaphysical or even meaningless. Fortunately, we have outgrown the most restrictive of the empiricist scruples, and so can get beyond mere name calling. […]
>
>Another sort of objection to tinkering with space-time structure runs as follows: Adopting relativistic principles, and especially demanding Lorentz invariance in Special relativistic domains, has been an extremely successful strategy. Why should this be so unless Relativity gives an accurate account of space-time structure? Won't any theory according to which Relativity is false involve a very Odd sort of conspiracy of physical law so that a non-relativistic space-time appears to be relativistic?
>
>I have myself voiced this sort of concern (Maudlin 1994), but now think that I failed to mark an important distinction. As noted above, there are two quite different ways to depart from Relativity. One is to eliminate the relativistic metrical structure entirely at the fundamental level, and to account for effects of relative motion (time dilation, Fitzgerald contraction) by a close analysis of physical effects on measuring devices. This is essentially the route followed by Bell in his Special Relativity paper (1976): postulate Newtonian space-time and Maxwell's equations, and show how electromagnetic effects in clocks and rods will hide the Newtonian structure from us. The other route is to retain the relativistic metric at the fundamental level, but to add something to it (e.g., a foliation). In this case, relativistic behavior can be explained in the same way it always was: some physical quantities are governed by equations framed in terms of the relativistic It is just that the evolution of some of the physical quantities also depends on the foliation.
>
>If some of the evolution depends on the foliation, though, how have we been able to get so far without it? was the rejection of absolute simultaneity by Einstein so successful? Ironically, the answer to this is the very same empirical unobservability that inspired the first objection! Observable space-time structure is solely the relativistic structure, so it is hardly surprising that Relativity should serve us so well.
>
>It is amusing and instructive to see how this picture could play out in a Bohmian milieu. Since there are no real collapses in Bohm's theory, the wave function has no need of the foliations. So the wave function could evolve in accord with a covariant equation, such as the Dirac equation. The guidance equation for the particles (or other local beables) would be framed with reference to the foliation. The ontological duality already at the base of the theory would map onto a similar duality of space-time structure, with the accuracy and effectiveness of Relativity being explained by the completely relativistic nature of the wave function. The beables would be sensitive to absolute simultaneity, but only in a completely unobservable way.
>
>Nothing quite so symmetrical seems likely for a collapse theory. Since collapse theories tend to be ontologically monist, the best one could do would be for the wave function to evolve sometimes relativistically and sometimes (during collapse) non-relativistically. The ontological duality of Bohm becomes dynamical duality in GRW, with the form of the evolution of the wave function changing during collapses. In the non-relativistic version, it is only the form of evolution that changes, while in the “relativistic” version here envisaged, even the quantities in terms of which the evolution is described would shift.
>
>How high is the price of abandoning Relativity in just this way (i.e., by adding a foliation to space-time)? It is hard to argue that the cost is automatically prohibitive. We would have to postulate some new space-time structure, but it would be exactly the sort of structure one would anticipate given both the experiments and the non-relativistic versions of the theory. There seem to be influences between events at spacelike separation, instantaneous influences in the classical milieu. A spacelike structure such as a hyperplane fairly directly recommends itself. As Bell remarks,
>
>>“[I]t may be that we have to admit that causal influences do go faster than light. The role of Lorentz invariance in the completed theory would then very problematic. An 'aether' would be the cheapest solution. But the unobservability of the aether would be disturbing.” (1987)
>
>One would think that the cheapest solution would recommend itself to the methodologically frugal. We should try some comparison shopping to see if anything less disturbing can be unearthed.

### Hyperplane dependence [p. 301]

>The natural ontology of Fleming's theory is monistic: the wave function is a complete representation of the physical reality. If Fleming intends to add additional variables to the theory, then we must know just what they are and, especially, how their dynamics are defined in order to be able to assess its compatibility with relativity. (Recall that Bohm's theory, since it contains no collapses, can have a covariant dynamics for the wave function, but not for the particle trajectories.) So there isn't some extra item, the measurement, which is represented by the various wave functions; rather one must somehow find the measurement operation in the wave function and its dynamics. As we have seen, the measurement causes collapse of the wave function. These collapses are governed by a dynamics defined on a family of hyperplanes, and each family of hyperplanes, it seems, operates essentially as an independent universal time for the wave functions associated with them. [...]
>
>If one adds additional variables, or adds collapses, then all of the action will be found in their dynamics. But any theory without either one or the other is not a coherent theory, and so further discussion of Relativity is pointless.

### Admonition and queries [p. 304]

>I would like to end with a plea and a series of questions. The plea is motivated by a worrying terminological trend. When Bell's theorem first appeared, it was often characterized as proving the impossibility of local deterministic theories or local hidden variables theories, implying that locality could be retained if only one abandoned hidden variables or determinism. Bell had to fight long and hard to show that neither determinism nor hidden variables were the issue: in my terminology, Bell's inequality cannot be violated by any local standard theory for events at spacelike separation, that is for any theory that interprets normal laboratory operations as producing measurement outcomes located where we think they are in space and time.
>
>Recently, a new bogeyman seems to have been found: realism. Thus Hardy states: “In 1965 Bell demonstrated that quantum mechanics is not a local realistic theory. He did this by deriving a set of inequalities and then showing that these inequalities are violated by quantum mechanics” (1992). The conversational implication is that Bell's theorem only applies to local realistic theories, so that locality (and hence perhaps also consistency with Relativity) can be recovered if one only jettisons realism. But no standard theory, even a non-realistic one (whatever that means) can be local, so we must reject the conversational implication.
>
>Realism in philosophy of science is generally contrasted with instrumentalism or empiricism, which views assert that one can have no grounds to believe that the unobservable ontology of a theory is accurate. In this sense, theories are neither realistic nor non-realistic, only interpretations of (or better: attitudes towards) theories. And the strongest argument in favor of instrumentalism, from Osiander onwards, is underdetermination: the existence of many incompatible theories all capable of ‘saving the phenomena’. The beauty of Bell's theorem, of course, is that it is insensitive to the details of the theory suggested: any theory which can save the phenomena (if the phenomena include claims about the behavior of macroscopic devices located in space and time) must be non-local. Even a classic instrumentalist would be forced to accept non-locality.
>
>But even supposing that somehow abandoning realism in quantum theory could preserve locality, we would have to wonder about the point of making such a bargain. Physicists have been tremendously resistant to any claims of non-locality, mostly on the assumption (which is not a theorem) that non-locality is inconsistent with Relativity. The calculus seems to be that one ought to be willing to pay any price – even the renunciation of pretensions to accurately describe the world – in order to preserve the theory of Relativity. But the only possible view that would make sense of this obsessive attachment to Relativity is a thoroughly realistic one! These physicists seem to be so certain that Relativity is the last word in space-time structure that they are willing even to forego any coherent account of the entities that inhabit space-time.
>
>An instrumentalist would hardly be so sanguine about Relativity. If one doubts our ability to get deep level ontology right, if one insists that the only proper role of theory is to grind out numbers, then it should hardly matter if we add a foliation to space-time in framing a theory, or even reject relativistic space-time structure entirely in favor of Newtonian absolute space and time. Oddly, Bernard d'Espagnat seems to have taken both of these steps: rejecting “ontological” interpretations of quantum theory on account of their non-locality, but then also insisting that we regard Relativity as “weakly objective” (i.e., not as an account of mind independent physical reality) (1995). But if the relativistic space-time structure is not objective, why in the world be so concerned with non- locality? It is simply bizarre to man the ramparts in defense of Relativity at the expense of an intelligible account of the material world.
>
>Further, one need not reject the relativistic account of space-time as accurate, just as complete. If one is certain that the relativistic account of the space-time metric reflects an objective feature of the world, that belief can be retained. As noted above, one can construct a Bohmian theory in which the wave function evolves relativistically, thus accounting for all relativistic effects. The additional foliation, needed for the dynamics of the local beables, is something that the theory of Relativity simply overlooked, as irrelevant to the phenomena it studied.
